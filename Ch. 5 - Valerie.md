The next time I visited her room was on a weekday. I’d just come from a lecture that might as well have been in another language. I was starting to get used to that kind of frustration.

I stopped in front of the familiar wooden door and, without hesitation, pushed it open. She never did like people knocking.

Rin was at her desk, the steady clicking of her keyboard filling the room. She didn’t even turn when I came in. How careless of her.

But it seemed Risa was here today, sitting at the low table, surrounded by a sea of plastic.

“Princess! Perfect timing,” Risa chirped, waving me over. “I’m about to attach the V-fin!”

I smiled at the nickname and settled into my usual spot. I sat on the left, beside the bed, while Risa had claimed the right, closer to Rin’s chair. If Rin ever decided to join us, she would take the top spot.

My eyes drifted to the project spread across the table. It was one of the robot models, like the ones that stood proudly in the dioramas on the shelves. At least part of one. The head, torso, and a single leg were complete, while the rest remained a bare grey skeleton. Around it lay a careful arrangement of tiny pieces still waiting on their frames, each one molded with excruciating detail that pulled my gaze from fragment to fragment.

The box beside it bore a cryptic name: GX-03 Mk.2 MG. I traced the letters with my finger, curious.

“What does this mean?” I asked.

Risa’s face lit up instantly. “MG? It means Master Grade! It’s a one-to-one-hundred scale, which gives you amazing inner frame detail, but it’s not as complex as a Perfect Grade, which has—”

Her voice was bright and enthusiastic, but I found myself more absorbed by the pieces spread across the table. There had to be hundreds of them, all still connected to their neat plastic frames. Each part was so small, yet molded with surprising care.

To think those models arrived like this, as fragments that had to be assembled into the figures on the shelves… it was like watching a puzzle transform into a sculpture.

I reached for the thick booklet lying open on the table. Its pages were filled with dense diagrams mapping out how the pieces should come together. 

After Risa was done with her explanation, she began showing me how to assemble the pieces. She clipped a piece loose, filed it down, and fitted it into place.

The process seemed simple, almost mechanical, yet I couldn’t look away. There was something strangely beautiful about the patience, the precision, the way each fragment slowly revealed the shape it was meant to become.

After she was done, she asked, “Want to help build a piece?”

My attention, however, had already wandered. I reached out and picked up what seemed to be one of the robot’s arms. The colors were striking: bright white, deep blue, a vivid red. Nothing like the dull, grey machines I had associated with a a robot.

“It looks a little like plastic,” I said, turning it over in my hands. I glanced toward the desk. “Aren’t these supposed to be made of metal?”

Rin answered without looking away from her screen. “The actual suits, you mean? A lunar alloy, technically. But yeah.”

So it was painted metal.

Before I could stop myself, my mind was already working. To make this white plastic look like painted metal, you’d need a matte undercoat first. Then a thin gloss layer for the sheen. After that… maybe a touch of dry-brushing with some light grey, just enough to catch the edges. Yes. That would work.

I looked at Risa, trying to mask the flicker of excitement that had slipped through. “Do people paint these?”

“The pros do!” she said eagerly. “But you have to be super skilled. We tried once and it was a disaster.” Her eyes lit up, a sudden spark of inspiration. “Wait a second… Princess. Do you know how to paint?”

All those years. All those grueling lessons. All that training I had tried so hard to leave behind.

“…A little,” I admitted.

Risa’s eyes shone. She reached across the table and grabbed both of my hands. “Please paint it for us! We always wanted to add weathering and details!”

I froze. For a moment, I hesitated. I had promised myself I would never pick up a brush again. And yet… 

The sharp scrape of a chair cut through the air. Rin pushed back from her desk, bumping into Risa’s side.

“You’re in the way, Risa,” she said flatly.

Risa blinked, then glanced up at her. Whatever she saw in Rin’s eyes made her immediately let go of my hands, raising her own in mock surrender.

Rin turned and walked toward the small kitchen space in the corner, a faint frown tugging at her face.

“Sorry, sorry! Didn’t mean to overstep. But you gotta admit, it would be so cool if we could add some battle damage…”

From the kitchen, Rin’s voice came thoughtful. “It would let us make more lore-accurate scenes, that’s for sure.”

“Like the battle at the southern islands!” Risa added, nodding enthusiastically.

Their voices carried a certain spark. I wanted to refuse... But I couldn’t. Not when they looked at me like that. Not when their excitement was so genuine. These girls… they were quickly becoming my friends. And I didn’t want to disappoint them.

It’s not a canvas, I told myself, my heart beating fast. It’s nothing like that. It's just a toy. Just adding bit of color on plastic. It’s more like applying makeup than painting.

I swallowed, trying to steady the rush in my chest. I’m not an artist anymore. I left that behind. But this… this might be different. This might be okay.

I let out a slow breath and gave them a small nod.

“Fine,” I said at last with quiet resignation. “Wait here. I’ll go get my things.”

I left the warmth and happy chaos of her room and walked the few steps next door to my own. I pushed the door open, and the difference struck me at once.

The walls were a muted beige and the floor was a blinding white that made this room feel larger than hers, though in truth they were about the same size. To the right, against the wall I shared with her, sat my bed. It was neatly made, as always, as if nobody had ever slept in it.

To the left stood my desk, bare except for a closed laptop resting in the center. Beside the bed, a single shelf stood against the wall. It was mostly empty, holding only the heavy textbooks from my classes, their spines lined up in a row like silent judges. They reminded me that I really should be studying right now.

Everything was clean and orderly, but it lacked something... something I couldn't quite name.

I crossed the room and opened the door to my walk-in closet. It was the one feature this room had that hers didn't. But like the rest of my room, it was mostly empty.

In the back, stacked neatly, were the boxes I was looking for. Pristine, expensive cases of dark wood and polished leather. The art supplies my mother kept sending. They sat there as her constant reminder of the life I was supposed to be living.

I knelt in front of the stack and pulled the first box toward me.

Inside, everything was arranged with the same suffocating precision I remembered from home. Brushes, dozens of them, all arranged in neat rows. The same order Mother had drilled into us, over and over, until we could place each one blindfolded. Round to the left, flats in the center, and filberts to the right, each sorted by size.

I remembered the sharp pain of a brush handle against the back of my hand whenever I slipped. Those were her lessons in perfection, a pain that left no room for error.

I ran my fingers over the handles, pausing on a tiny 2/0 round brush, its bristles worn but still sharp enough for detail work. I set it aside. It might be useful.

The next box was heavier. Palettes, stacked one over the other, their surfaces stained with the remains of colors long since dried. My hand hovered over one with a hairline crack running through the wood. I remembered the day I'd thrown it, years ago, when I was still a child. The sound it made when it hit the floor. The silence that followed. The disapproving stares. I closed the lid without taking anything.

The third box was filled with paints. Tubes of every shade, their labels smudged with fingerprints from another life. My gaze caught on cobalt blue, and a sharp sting of shame rose in my throat. I could still hear my tutor's voice, dripping with disdain. "An unrealistic color, Miss Valerie. We are capturing life as it is, not as you wish it to be."

I forced the memory down and began pulling out what I needed. My old canvas paints wouldn't cling to plastic. They'd peel and flake no matter how carefully I applied them. What I needed was a base.

My hand found a bottle of primer, the kind that would bite into the surface and hold the color in place. Next came a silver enamel, perfect for scratches and edges. Then a few shades of grey, some muted whites, a deep red, a dark blue, colors that would match the base plastic of the model.

I grabbed one of the leather satchels I used to carry to lessons, pulled it open and dropped the supplies inside. The brushes, the paints, the primer. They clattered against each other in a messy heap—a small, defiant act against the rigid order Mother had demanded.

I didn’t linger. The air in here felt heavier with every breath, thick with ghosts I had no wish to face. Slinging the bag over my shoulder, I shut the closet door and walked quickly out of the room.

Back to her room.

The moment I stepped back into their room, the tension in my shoulders eased. It was a relief so profound it almost made me dizzy.

When she noticed me, Risa looked up with a wide grin. In the center of the table, the robot model was finally complete, its grey skeleton hidden beneath bright plates of white, blue, and red armor. It stood with one hand on its hip, almost as if it had been waiting for me.

“Princess! You’re back!”

Risa carelessly lifted the model and held it out to me with both hands, her gaze lowered as if presenting an offering. I set my satchel down and accepted it. Carefully, I turned it in my hands and tested a shoulder joint, then an elbow, rotating the arm through its full range of motion. The movement was almost lifelike, and far more flexible than I had expected. It was also surprisingly sturdy.

“The articulation is incredible,” I murmured, unable to hide the wonder in my voice. “It moves so much.”

“Right?!” Risa beamed. “That’s the new joint system version 2.0! It gives it a full 180-degree pectoral rotation and even has a double-jointed knee that allows for more stances. It’s almost as posable as a Perfect Grade, but without the nightmare of putting together a thousand tiny frame parts for—”

This wasn’t like the stiff action toys I’d seen. Every joint felt engineered with purpose. It was a true scale model, but a scale model of something that didn’t exist. The design was so practical, so grounded. Almost as if it _could_ exist, if only someone decided to make it larger. I was honestly impressed. 

Wile Risa was still lost in her explanation, I turned my attention to the corner of the room, where Rin sat at her desk.

"Rin," I said, . "For the scene you want to make, in what condition is this... robot?"

She turned in her chair, pushing her glasses up her nose. "Condition? What do you mean?"

"Is it supposed to be old? Has it been in a battle, taken any damage? Is there rust, or dirt?"

A flicker of understanding crossed her face. She glanced at a diorama on her shelf before answering. "Oh. Nah, for that scene, this one's brand new. Fresh off the assembly line."

"I see..." I said. That's a good place to start. A blank canvas.

"Go nuts," Rin added, turning back to her screen. "And don't worry if you screw it up. We mess them up all the time."

I gave her a small nod and turned back to the table. Unlatching my leather satchel, I tipped it over and let everything spill onto the floor in a messy heap. Brushes, paints, bottles—all of it scattered without any order. I glanced around, but neither of them batted an eye. Risa was still talking to herself, and Rin hadn’t even looked back from her screen.

This was strangely liberating. Nobody here cared. Everyone was so absorbed in the things they loved, that it didn’t matter how I worked, or even what I chose to do.

I reached down, grabbed a stray piece of cardboard from the model’s box, and set it on the table as a makeshift palette.

The primer was thick. It was originally meant for canvas, after all. It would smother the details if I wasn’t careful, but it was all I had. I poured a little into a bottle cap and dipped the smallest brush into the liquid.

I tested it on a hidden spot, the inside of the thigh armor. The stroke ended up thicker than what I would have liked, but it clung. It worked.

My hands moved without hesitation, mixing paint on the cardboard. White, but not the flat, blinding white of the plastic. I added the tiniest touch of raw umber to dull the glare, then a breath of yellow ochre for warmth.

I loaded the brush and pressed it to the shoulder armor. With one smooth stroke, the plastic sheen vanished, replaced by a soft matte finish that gave the piece weight. Substance. 

"Whoa… Princess," Risa whispered, her eyes wide. "You’re incredible! It already looks so much better!"

_It’s just a base coat,_ I thought, as my old lessons echoed in my mind. There’s nothing skillful about this part. It’s but the boring work you do before the real painting begins.

"Thank you," I said, offering her a small, tight smile.

My teacher would be rapping my knuckles right about now. _The surface is improperly prepared, Miss Valerie. The color is not accurate. Your strokes are rough. This is not the right brush, nor the right paint..._

_... you'll never be like her at this rate._
