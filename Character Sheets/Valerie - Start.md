# Character Sheet: Valerie "Lily" Linden (Start of Story - The Spider Lily)

## Core Information
* **Public Role:** The Seeker / The Clueless Princess. A graceful but seemingly naive girl trying to find her way in a new world.
* **True Role:** The Playful Seductress / The Mastermind. An incredibly perceptive girl who, having escaped her rigid past, decides to have fun by playfully pursuing the cute, flustered nerd next door.
* **Age:** 18
* **Studies:** Computer Science (chosen out of spite, and now a convenient excuse).

## Personality & Expression
* **Public Persona (The Mask):** Poised, unfailingly polite, and deeply earnest. She often appears gracefully clumsy in romantic-comedy situations, and seems completely oblivious to social and romantic subtext. This is a carefully maintained performance.
* **Private Self (The Truth):** Sharp, mischievous, observant, and surprisingly confident. She reads people and situations with the keen eye of a painter. She finds Karin's panicked reactions adorable and sees teasing her as an entertaining, high-stakes game. She is playing to win.
* **Speech Patterns:** Her precise, simple, and earnest way of speaking is a part of her "innocent girl" persona. Every seemingly naive question or literal interpretation is a calculated move. Her "Please be my teacher" was a masterful opening gambit.
* **Narrative Signals (The "Tells"):**
    * Her "clumsiness" is often perfectly timed to create chaotic, intimate situations that only affect Karin.
    * Her eyes, which Karin perceives as turning **red**, are a key indicator of her "succubus mode." This happens when she sees an opportunity to tease or is enjoying the result of her efforts.
    * She hides subtle, momentary smirks. A "tsk" of disappointment might escape her when a plan is thwarted (like by Risa's interruption).

## Backstory & Internal World
* **Backstory:** Her history as the burnt-out daughter of a fine-art dynasty is completely true. The pressure, the joylessness, and the rebellion are all real. This backstory is the genuine reason she is at the dorm.
* **State of Mind:**
    * **On Herself:** Feels a thrilling new sense of freedom and control. Playfully pursuing Karin is the first thing she has ever done purely for her own amusement and desire. It is her true act of rebellion and self-discovery.
    * **On Karin:** She was attracted to her from the moment she saw her. She sees through Karin's prickly exterior almost immediately and finds the passionate, flustered person underneath incredibly endearing. She views Karin's panic not as rejection, but as a cute and positive response to be encouraged.
* **Wounds & Limiting Beliefs:**
    * **Core Wound:** Her creative burnout and joyless upbringing are real. This makes her new "game" with Karin all the more exhilarating.
    * **Limiting Belief:** She has none regarding her ability to get what she wants. Her primary challenge is how to win over Karin without her methods being discovered too early.
* **Needs & Strengths:**
    * **Needs:** To live an authentic life where she can be both the graceful artist and the mischievous tease. To win the affection of the girl who sparked her interest.
    * **Strengths:** Master of plausible deniability. Highly perceptive emotional intelligence. Strategic thinking. And all her previously established skills (poise, grace, artistic talent) which she now uses as tools in her playful courtship.
