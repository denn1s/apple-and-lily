# Character Sheet: Valerie "Lily" Linden

## Core Information
* **Role in Story:** The Seeker / The Catalyst. She is the "normal" outsider whose arrival disrupts the dorm's ecosystem and initiates the main plot. Her journey is about discovering an authentic self and the meaning of "home."
* **Age:** 18 (University Freshman)
* **Studies:** Computer Science at an unnamed US university. She shares this major with Karin and Risa, though she has no passion for it.

## Personality & Expression
* **Personality:** Outwardly, she is poised, polite, and exceptionally graceful due to a lifetime of training. Inwardly, she is deeply earnest, observant, and curious about the world outside her curated bubble. She is a people-pleaser by habit but is beginning to feel the first stirrings of rebellion and personal desire. She follows instructions diligently but is starting to question *why*.
* **Emotional Traits:** Prone to feeling hollow, empty, and overwhelmed by her family's expectations. Her default state is a kind of gentle, numb compliance. When faced with genuine passion (like in Karin's room), her primary emotions are wide-eyed fascination and a desperate, almost childlike, curiosity.
* **Speech Patterns:**
    * **General:** Her speech is clear, precise, and often formal, even in casual settings. She uses full sentences and avoids slang, not out of snobbery, but because she simply doesn't know it.
    * **Quirk:** She unconsciously favors simpler words with Germanic origins over more complex Latinate ones. While her mother taught her to sound "sophisticated," her true self prefers directness. She'll say "a *big* help" instead of "a *tremendous* asset," or that something feels "*real*" instead of "*authentic*."
    * **Example Quotes:**
        > "I'm sorry to bother you, my name is Valerie Linden."
        > "I've never seen so many things in one place before. It feels very... colorful. Very alive."
        > "I don't know what I like. I've never really been asked."
* **Narrative Signals (Non-Verbal):**
    * She has perfect posture, a result of years of dance and deportment lessons. She holds herself very still.
    * Her default expression is a polite, slightly distant smileâ€”a mask she's worn her whole life.
    * Her genuine emotions are shown through her eyes, which widen with honest curiosity and fascination when she encounters something new and passionate. A true, unguarded smile from her is a rare and significant event.

## Backstory & Internal World
* **Backstory:** Raised by a demanding, image-conscious, and emotionally absent mother who curated every aspect of her life. Her childhood was a packed schedule of lessons designed to create a "perfect" daughter: piano, dance, modeling, vocal training, and deportment. She has never had a real friend or developed a personal hobby.
* **State of Mind:** Feels lost and directionless. She knows she is unhappy with her life but doesn't know what the alternative looks like. She sees her skills as chores and her life as a performance.
    * **On Herself:** Feels hollow and fake. She believes she has no "real" personality beneath the polished exterior.
    * **On Her Family:** Views her mother with a sense of duty and fear; her sister is a rival and a symbol of the life she's supposed to want. The family dynamic is built on performance, not love.
    * **On Society:** Sees the "high-class" world she comes from as sterile and constricting. She is intrigued and slightly intimidated by the "normal" world of her peers.
* **Wounds & Limiting Beliefs:**
    * **Core Wound:** Having her identity suppressed her entire life has left her feeling like she doesn't truly exist.
    * **Limiting Belief:** "I have no passions of my own; I am a blank slate." She also believes the skills her mother forced on her are useless burdens tied to a life she hates.
* **Needs & Strengths:**
    * **Needs:** To find a safe space where she can be imperfect. To discover a genuine interest. To form a real, non-transactional friendship. To feel "at home."
    * **Strengths:** Despite her feelings, she possesses immense diligence and resilience. Her social grace, while a mask, allows her to navigate new situations without initial conflict. She has numerous "hidden" talents (a beautiful singing/speaking voice, physical grace) that she has yet to see as assets. Her greatest strength is her deep, untarnished curiosity.
