# Character Sheet: Valerie "Lily" Linden

## Core Information
* **Public Role:** The Seeker / The Clueless Princess. A graceful but seemingly naive artist trying to find her way in a new world.
* **True Role:** The Playful Seductress / The Mastermind. An incredibly perceptive girl who, having escaped her rigid past, decides to have fun by playfully pursuing the cute, flustered nerd next door.
* **Age:** 18
* **Studies:** Computer Science (chosen out of spite to escape her family's world of art).

## Personality & Expression
* **Public Persona (The Mask):** Poised, unfailingly polite, and deeply earnest. She often appears gracefully clumsy in romantic-comedy situations and seems completely oblivious to social and romantic subtext. This is a carefully maintained performance.
* **Private Self (The Truth):** Sharp, mischievous, observant, and surprisingly confident. She reads people and situations with the keen eye of a painter. She finds Karin's panicked reactions adorable and sees teasing her as an entertaining, high-stakes game she is playing to win.
* **Speech Patterns:** Her precise, simple, and earnest way of speaking is a part of her "innocent girl" persona. Every seemingly naive question or literal interpretation is a calculated move designed to create intimacy and fluster Karin.
* **Narrative Signals (The "Tells"):**
    * Her "clumsiness" is often perfectly timed to create chaotic, intimate situations that only affect Karin.
    * Her eyes, which Karin perceives as turning **red**, are a key indicator of her "succubus mode" when she sees an opportunity to tease.
    * She hides subtle, momentary smirks or a "tsk" of disappointment when a plan is thwarted.

## Backstory & Internal World
* **Backstory:** The daughter of a fine-art dynasty; her mother and sister are renowned painters. Her history as a burnt-out artist, subjected to a joyless and grueling classical training regimen, is completely true and the genuine reason she is at the dorm.
* **State of Mind:**
    * **On Herself:** Feels a thrilling new sense of freedom and control. Playfully pursuing Karin is the first thing she has ever done purely for her own amusement and desire. It is her true act of rebellion and self-discovery.
    * **On Karin:** She was attracted to her from the moment she entered the room. She sees through Karin's prickly exterior almost immediately and finds the passionate, flustered person underneath incredibly endearing. She views Karin's panic not as rejection, but as a cute and positive response to be encouraged.
* **Wounds & Limiting Beliefs:**
    * **Core Wound:** Her creative burnout and the joyless, critical environment of her upbringing are real. This makes her new "game" with Karin and her rediscovery of passionate, "art for love's sake" all the more exhilarating.
* **Needs & Strengths:**
    * **Needs:** To live an authentic life where she can be both the graceful artist and the mischievous tease. To win the affection of the girl who sparked her interest.
    * **Strengths:** Master of plausible deniability. Highly perceptive emotional intelligence. Strategic thinking. Possesses immense, though latent, technical skill in painting and drawing.
