# Character Sheet: Karin "Rin" Connelly

## Core Information
* **Role in Story:** The Recluse / The Guarded Heart. Her room is her fortress. Her journey is about learning to feel safe enough with someone to take the first steps back into the outside world.
* **Age:** 19 (University Freshman)
* **Studies:** Computer Science. She is competent but not passionate about it. She chose this major pragmatically as a field that offers remote work, aligning with the early onset of her agoraphobia.

## Personality & Expression
* **Personality:** Prickly, cynical, and highly anxious. Her standoffishness is a defense mechanism for a severe social anxiety and developing agoraphobia. She is incredibly passionate about her hobbies but hides this behind a wall of sarcasm. With her close friends, her guard can lower, revealing a softer, more vulnerable core. Her online persona, "Ringo-sensei," is the confident, wise mentor she wishes she could be.
* She is crude in her speech, but since she is also a bit of a coward, her speech is mostly family-friendly crude. Her crudeness only includes crude words occasionally, except when she is in her panic state. The more panic she feels, the cruder she gets. The only exception is the panic caused to her as a consequence of her onset agoraphobia, where she usually freezes and withdraws. 
* **Narrative Signals:** Avoids eye contact and physically hides behind her screen or hair. She shows extreme reluctance to leave her room, and any mention of the outside world makes her visibly tense.

## Core Wound & Backstory
* **The Core Wound:** In her first year of high school, her fanfiction was discovered and publicly shared by a crush, leading to school-wide humiliation and shaming from teachers. This cemented a deep-seated belief that her authentic self is a source of pain and ridicule.
* **The Aftermath & Backstory:**
    * Risa, a second-year at the time, witnessed the fallout and became Karin's fierce protector and only friend.
    * Karin's anxiety escalated, causing her to attend her second year of high school irregularly and stop attending in-person classes altogether in her third year.
    * She moved to the dorm on Risa's advice as a "safe" first step toward recovery, with a medical justification for remote learning.

## State of Mind & Daily Life
* **State of Mind:** Her worldview is defined by the safety of her room versus the danger of the outside. She is terrified of repeating past trauma and feels "broken," but has a deeply buried spark of courage that led her to move to the dorm.
* **Limiting Beliefs:** "The world outside my room is not safe for me." "If people see the real me, they will hurt me."
* **Daily Life & Consequences:**
    * She does not attend lectures and only leaves the dorm for mandatory exams.
    * She gets groceries delivered but struggles with the anxiety of opening the door.
    * She relies on Risa for any errands that require leaving the dorm.

## Strengths
* **Creativity:** A talented and disciplined writer, which is her escape and one area of confidence.
* **Loyalty:** Incredibly loyal to Risa.
* **Hidden Courage:** Despite her fears, her decision to move to the dorm shows a deep, underlying desire to get better.
