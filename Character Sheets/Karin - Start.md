# Character Sheet: Karin "Rin" Connelly

## Core Information
* **Role in Story:** The Recluse / The Guarded Heart. Her room is her fortress and the story's initial primary setting. Her journey is about learning to feel safe enough with someone to take the first steps back into the outside world.
* **Age:** 19 (University Freshman)
* **Studies:** Computer Science. She is competent but not passionate about it. She chose this major pragmatically, as it's a field that offers many remote work opportunities, aligning with her desire to not leave her room.

## Personality & Expression
* **Personality:** Prickly, cynical, and highly anxious. Her standoffishness is a defense mechanism for a severe social anxiety that borders on agoraphobia. She is incredibly sharp and passionate about her hobbies but hides this behind a wall of sarcasm and reclusiveness. With Risa (and eventually Lily), her guard can lower, revealing a softer, more vulnerable, and surprisingly witty core. Her online persona, "Ringo-sensei," is the confident, wise mentor she wishes she could be in real life.
* **Speech Patterns:** Terse and dismissive with strangers (even delivery people). Expressive and full of fandom slang with Risa. She uses her writing as her primary form of honest communication.
* **Narrative Signals:** Avoids eye contact, physically hides behind her screen or hair. She shows extreme reluctance to leave her room, and any mention of the outside world makes her visibly tense. Her reaction to an unexpected knock is one of genuine fear, not just annoyance.

## Core Wound & Backstory
* **The Core Wound:** The traumatic event occurred in her first year of high school. Her fanfiction, which contained early explorations of yuri themes, was discovered and publicly shared by a crush. The resulting school-wide humiliation and shaming from teachers and peers cemented a deep-seated belief that her authentic self (her passions, her sexuality) is a source of pain and ridicule.
* **The Aftermath & Backstory:**
    * Risa, a second-year at the time, witnessed the fallout and became Karin's fierce protector and only friend.
    * Karin attended her second year of high school irregularly, with her anxiety escalating.
    * By her third year, she stopped attending in-person classes altogether, finishing her studies remotely.
    * She moved to the dorm on Risa's advice as a "safe" first step toward recovery. She has an official medical justification for remote learning, only being required to show up for critical events like final exams.

## State of Mind & Daily Life
* **State of Mind:** Her worldview is defined by the safety of her room versus the danger of the outside. She is deeply pessimistic about her ability to connect with new people and terrified of repeating past trauma. She feels "broken" but also has a tiny, deeply buried spark of courage, which is what led her to agree to move to the dorm in the first place.
* **Limiting Beliefs:** "The world outside my room is not safe for me." "If people see the real me, they will hurt me." "I am not capable of normal social interaction."
* **Needs:** An overwhelming need for safety and control over her environment. A deeper, unacknowledged need for someone to gently and patiently help her break down her walls and reconnect with the world.
* **Daily Life & Consequences:**
    * **Classes:** She does not attend lectures. She studies remotely and only leaves the dorm for mandatory final exams.
    * **Errands:** She gets almost everything, including groceries, delivered. She struggles immensely with the simple act of opening the door to a delivery person, often bundling up in hoodies and glasses to feel disguised.
    * **Reliance:** When delivery is not an option, Risa is her designated person to run errands. The thought of asking a new person (like Lily) for this kind of help would be a source of intense vulnerability and a major plot point.

## Strengths
* **Creativity:** She is a talented and disciplined writer, able to build entire worlds in her head. Her writing is her escape and her one area of genuine confidence.
* **Loyalty:** She is incredibly loyal to Risa, the one person who has consistently been there for her.
* **Hidden Courage:** Despite her fears, she took the massive step of moving away from her parents and into the dorm. This shows a deep, underlying desire to get better, even if she's currently stalled.
