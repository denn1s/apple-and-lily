# Character Sheet: Karin "Rin" Connelly

## Core Information
* **Role in Story:** The Guarded Heart / The Mentor. She is the keeper of the "sanctuary" that Lily seeks to enter. Her journey is about dismantling the walls she's built around her heart and learning to trust someone with her authentic, nerdy self.
* **Age:** 19 (University Freshman)
* **Studies:** Computer Science at an unnamed US university. She is competent enough in her studies but is not particularly passionate about them.
* **Passion:** She is very passionate about writing fanfiction and spends most of her days writing. 

## Personality & Expression
* **Personality:** Prickly, cynical, and socially anxious to the extreme, especially around people she perceives as "normal." She uses a standoffish and sarcastic exterior as armor to protect a deeply passionate and vulnerable core. With her one friend, Risa, she can relax slightly, revealing a snarky sense of humor and an intense passion for her hobbies. Her online persona, "Ringo-sensei," is confident, wise, and kind—the complete opposite of how she presents in person.
* **Emotional Traits:** Her default state is high-functioning anxiety. She is prone to overthinking, assuming the worst-case scenario, and panicking when her routine or safe space is breached. Joy and excitement are reserved for her private hobbies or rare moments with Risa.
* **Speech Patterns:**
    * **General:** With strangers, her speech is often terse, mumbled, or dismissive. She tries to end interactions as quickly as possible. With Risa, she is much more expressive, using a lot of internet and fandom-specific slang.
    * She has a sharp tongue and comes up as sharp and rude to others.  
    * Her internal monologue is seemingly always panicking. She tends to ask people for time to think so she can focus. She is bad at multitasking, so she can't think and talk to others, that's why she wants for calm spaces to think. When she is thinking, she talks to herself a lot, often referring to herself in third person using "Karin" as her name.
    * In her internal monologue, she is sharp and rude as well. 
    * **Quirk:** She deflects genuine emotional conversation with aggressive nerd-splaining or sarcasm. She is far more articulate and honest in her writing than she ever is out loud. She is knowledgeable about Japanese culture and uses terms from nerd, otaku culture. When speaking and talking in english, she still uses a lot of foreign words and english words with latin origin. 
    * **Example Quotes:**
        > "What the actual hell."
        > "You wouldn't understand."
        > "Huff"
* **Narrative Signals (Non-Verbal):**
    * Actively avoids eye contact.
    * Often physically hidden behind her laptop screen, a book, or her hair.
    * Her posture is often curled inward, a defensive stance, especially when sitting at her kotatsu.
    * Freezes like a deer in headlights when startled or caught off guard. Fidgets with her hands or clothes when anxious.

## Backstory & Internal World
* **Backstory:** Experienced years of minor rejections for her otaku hobbies in middle school. This culminated in a major traumatic event in high school when a girl she had a crush on discovered her fanfiction pseudonym, leading to public humiliation, bullying, and being shamed by the school's administration. Her parents, while not malicious, were emotionally distant and offered no support, teaching her she could only rely on herself.
* As a fanfiction writer, she is very confident and very popular (for her niche). She is passionate about writing but it is also a form of escapism. 
* **State of Mind:** Deeply pessimistic about social interaction. She believes her happiness is contingent on maintaining the safety and secrecy of her room and her online identity.
    * **On Herself:** Believes she is fundamentally "weird," "broken," and unworthy of acceptance from anyone outside her tiny subculture. She has intense impostor syndrome, feeling that her confident "Ringo-sensei" persona is a lie.
    * **On Her Family:** Views them with resigned indifference. She knows they provide for her material needs but expects no emotional support and therefore offers none in return.
    * **On Society:** Views the "normal" world as hostile and judgmental. She sees people like Lily as a potential threat—beautiful, popular, and destined to misunderstand and mock her.
* **Wounds & Limiting Beliefs:**
    * **Core Wound:** Public humiliation and betrayal tied directly to her passions (writing) and her sexuality (yuri).
    * **Limiting Belief:** "If I show my true self to anyone 'normal,' I will be rejected and ridiculed. It is safer to be alone." Also, "Someone like her (Lily) could never genuinely like someone like me."
* **Needs & Strengths:**
    * **Needs:** To feel safe enough to be vulnerable. To be seen and accepted for her *entire* self—the anxious girl and the talented author. To learn that her past trauma does not have to predict her future.
    * **Strengths:** Despite her anxiety, she is a highly talented and disciplined writer. She is fiercely passionate and deeply knowledgeable about her interests. She is capable of deep loyalty (as seen with Risa) and has a hidden well of empathy, which is evident in her stories.
