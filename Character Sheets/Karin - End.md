# Character Sheet: Karin "Rin" Connelly

## Core Information

- **Role in Story:** The Guarded Heart / The Mentor. She is the keeper of the "sanctuary" that Lily seeks to enter. Her journey is about dismantling the walls she's built around her heart and learning to trust someone with her authentic, nerdy self.
    
- **Age:** 19 (University Freshman)
    
- **Studies:** Computer Science at an unnamed US university. She is competent enough in her studies but is not particularly passionate about them. Her internal voice is more influenced by her fandom life than her academic one.
    
- **Passion:** She is very passionate about writing fanfiction and spends most of her days writing.
    

## Personality & Expression

- **Personality:** Prickly, cynical, and socially anxious to the extreme, especially around people she perceives as "normal." She uses a standoffish and sarcastic exterior as armor to protect a deeply passionate and vulnerable core. With her one friend, Risa, she can relax slightly, revealing a snarky sense of humor and an intense passion for her hobbies. Her online persona, "Ringo-sensei," is confident, wise, and kind—the complete opposite of how she presents in person.
    
- **Emotional Traits:** Her default state is high-functioning anxiety. She is prone to overthinking, assuming the worst-case scenario, and panicking when her routine or safe space is breached. Joy and excitement are reserved for her private hobbies or rare moments with Risa.
    
- **Speech Patterns:**
    
    - **General:** With strangers, her speech is often terse, mumbled, or dismissive. She tries to end interactions as quickly as possible. With Risa, she is much more expressive.
        
    - She has a sharp tongue and comes across as rude to others.
        
    - Her internal monologue is a chaotic storm of scattered, self-deprecating thoughts. When panicked, her mind races with short, punchy sentences and frantic self-correction. She often talks to herself, sometimes referring to herself in the third person ("Karin") as a way to try and get a grip.
        
    - **Quirk:** She deflects genuine emotional conversation with sarcasm or by launching into overly-detailed explanations of niche topics from her fandoms. She is far more articulate and honest in her writing than she ever is out loud. She is knowledgeable about Japanese culture and uses terms from otaku culture, but her internal voice is primarily flavored with modern, informal internet slang rather than technical jargon from her studies.
        
    - **Example Quotes:**
        
        > "What the actual hell." "You wouldn't understand." "Nope." (deadpan)
        
- **Narrative Signals (Non-Verbal):**
    
    - Actively avoids eye contact.
        
    - Often physically hidden behind her laptop screen, a book, or her hair.
        
    - Her posture is often curled inward, a defensive stance.
        
    - Freezes like a deer in headlights when startled or caught off guard. Fidgets with her hands or clothes when anxious.
        

## Backstory & Internal World

- **Backstory:** Experienced years of minor rejections for her otaku hobbies in middle school. This culminated in a major traumatic event in high school when a girl she had a crush on discovered her fanfiction pseudonym, leading to public humiliation and bullying. Her parents, while not malicious, were emotionally distant and offered no support, teaching her she could only rely on herself.
    
- As a fanfiction writer, she is very confident and popular (for her niche). Writing is both her passion and her primary form of escapism.
    
- **State of Mind:** Deeply pessimistic about social interaction. She believes her happiness is contingent on maintaining the safety and secrecy of her room and her online identity.
    
    - **On Herself:** Believes she is fundamentally "weird," "broken," and unworthy of acceptance from anyone outside her tiny subculture. She has intense impostor syndrome, feeling that her confident "Ringo-sensei" persona is a lie.
        
    - **On Her Family:** Views them with resigned indifference. She knows they provide for her material needs but expects no emotional support and therefore offers none in return.
        
    - **On Society:** Views the "normal" world as hostile and judgmental. She sees people like the girl in her room as a potential threat—beautiful, popular, and destined to misunderstand and mock her.
        
- **Wounds & Limiting Beliefs:**
    
    - **Core Wound:** Public humiliation and betrayal tied directly to her passions (writing) and her sexuality (yuri).
        
    - **Limiting Belief:** "If I show my true self to anyone 'normal,' I will be rejected and ridiculed. It is safer to be alone."
        
- **Needs & Strengths:**
    
    - **Needs:** To feel safe enough to be vulnerable. To be seen and accepted for her _entire_ self—the anxious girl and the talented author. To learn that her past trauma does not have to predict her future.
        
    - **Strengths:** Despite her anxiety, she is a highly talented and disciplined writer. She is fiercely passionate and deeply knowledgeable about her interests. She is capable of deep loyalty (as seen with Risa) and has a hidden well of empathy, which is evident in her stories.
