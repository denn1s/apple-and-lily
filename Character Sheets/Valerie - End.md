# Character Sheet: Valerie "Lily" Linden (End of Story - The Spider Lily)

## Core Information
* **Public Role:** The Heart and Keystone of the dorm. Still seen by most as sweet and earnest.
* **True Role:** The Loving Partner & resident agent of chaos. Her teasing of Karin has become an open, affectionate part of their dynamic.
* **Age:** 19
* **Studies:** Happily switching to Digital Art, her new, genuine passion.

## Personality & Expression
* **Personality:** The "mask" and the "true self" have integrated. She is genuinely kind and supportive, but that kindness is now blended with a confident, mischievous wit. She no longer needs to hide her intelligence or intent, at least not from Karin and Risa.
* **Narrative Signals:** Her "tells" (the red eyes, the smirks) are no longer secret hints for the reader, but open signals to Karin. Karin now knows that when Lily's eyes "turn red," she's about to do something playfully demonic, and she can react with fond exasperation instead of pure panic.

## Journey & Internal World
* **Key Events (Re-contextualized):**
    * **The "Lessons":** Were a series of calculated moves to create intimacy and gauge Karin's reactions.
    * **The "Accidents":** Every clumsy fall or opportune situation was an intentional gambit to close the distance.
    * **The "Limousine" Conflict:** While genuinely stressful, her return to the dorm was a decisive choice. Her subsequent comforting of Karin was also a move to solidify their bond.
    * **The Final Confession Arc:** Her line, "Don't give up... you might have a chance," was a direct and calculated piece of encouragement. She allowed the dorm mates to lock them in the room, knowing it was the perfect "final stage" for Karin to overcome her last fear.
* **State of Mind:**
    * **On Herself:** She feels whole, happy, and authentic. She has successfully built a life where her artistic passion and her playful, "demonic" personality can coexist.
    * **On Karin:** She is deeply in love. She still finds Karin's reactions adorable, but her teasing is now balanced with genuine reassurance and deep affection. She understands and respects Karin's boundaries, even as she playfully pushes them.
* **Wounds & Limiting Beliefs:**
    * **Core Wound:** The wound from her past has healed, largely because her new life—including her playful pursuit of Karin—was the ultimate act of reclaiming her own joy.
* **Strengths:** Her greatest strength is revealed to be her profound emotional intelligence and her patient, if chaotic, devotion. She understood what Karin needed—to be challenged, to be pursued, and to be shown that someone could see all her "weirdness" and not just accept it, but adore it.
