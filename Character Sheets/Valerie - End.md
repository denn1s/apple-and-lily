# Character Sheet: Valerie "Lily" Linden (End of Story)

## Core Information
* **Role in Story:** The Heart / The Keystone. Initially the catalyst, she has become the emotional center of the dorm community, the person whose journey to find a home helped everyone else solidify their own.
* **Age:** 19 (End of her freshman year)
* **Studies:** Computer Science at an unnamed US university. While it's not her core passion, with the help of Karin and Risa, she is now competent and passing her classes. She views it as a means to an end, not the definition of her life.

## Personality & Expression
* **Personality:** Her innate grace and politeness remain, but they are now infused with a quiet, self-assured confidence. The earnest curiosity has blossomed into genuine engagement. The people-pleasing habit has been replaced by a fierce loyalty and a desire to support her friends. She has discovered a playful, silly side she never knew she had.
* **Emotional Traits:** The feeling of hollowness has been filled. She is now emotionally resilient, capable of identifying her own needs and acting on them (e.g., seeking comfort, offering it to others). She experiences and expresses genuine joy freely with her friends. She is deeply empathetic to Karin's anxieties.
* **Speech Patterns:**
    * **General:** Still speaks clearly and precisely, but her formality has softened into warmth. She has picked up some of the group's nerdy inside jokes and uses them with a gentle, sometimes slightly incorrect, earnestness that the others find endearing.
    * **Quirk:** Her preference for simple, direct language remains, but now it feels less like a quirk and more like a sign of her emotional honesty.
    * **Example Quotes:**
        > "Don't give up, Rin. You do have a chance... I want you to have a chance."
        > "My room finally feels like *me*. It's full of things I love, because of people I love."
* **Narrative Signals (Non-Verbal):**
    * Her perfect posture is now relaxed and natural, not rigid.
    * Her smiles are frequent and genuine, reaching her eyes without hesitation.
    * She now initiates casual physical contact—a hand on a shoulder, a shared blanket, a hug—seeing it as a natural expression of the comfort she feels.

## Journey & Internal World
* **Key Events of Her Journey:**
    * **Finding the Spark:** Meeting Karin and misinterpreting her "lessons" as a gateway to the passionate, "colorful" world she craved.
    * **Finding Safety:** The "Cup Ramen Night," where Karin's room transformed from a place of study into a true safe haven.
    * **Finding Her Voice:** Participating in Risa's visual novel project, discovering her vocal talents could be used for fun and art.
    * **Finding Her Passions:** Joining the "dorm adventures," where she modeled for Victoria and helped Celeste overcome her artist's block, realizing she loves being part of the creative process.
    * **Choosing Her Home:** The incident with her sister's limousine, which solidified her rejection of her old life and her commitment to her new one.
    * **Finding Love:** Realizing her feelings for Karin were real during the final party, and having the courage to follow and comfort her, leading to their mutual confession.
* **State of Mind:**
    * **On Herself:** Feels whole and authentic for the first time. She is proud of the passions she's collected and sees her past skills as valuable tools she has successfully reclaimed.
    * **On Her Family:** The relationship is still complicated, but it no longer defines or controls her. She has the confidence and support system to set boundaries and live her own life.
    * **On Society:** No longer feels like an outsider. She has found her "world" and her people, and feels no pressure to conform to any other standard.
* **Wounds & Limiting Beliefs:**
    * **Core Wound:** The wound of her suppressed identity is now a healing scar. It reminds her of where she came from, but no longer dictates where she is going.
    * **Limiting Belief:** The belief that she was a "blank slate" has been completely shattered. Her new, minor fear is the fear of losing the home and family she's fought so hard to build.
* **Needs & Strengths:**
    * **Needs:** Her primary need has shifted from *finding* a home to *nurturing and protecting* the home she has built with Karin and her friends.
    * **Strengths:** Her diligence and curiosity are now channeled into her passions and friendships. Her social grace is now a tool for genuine connection. Her "hidden talents" are now proven skills she uses with confidence. Her greatest strength has become her emotional honesty and her unwavering loyalty to the people she loves.
