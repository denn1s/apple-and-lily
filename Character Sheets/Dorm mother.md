# Character Sheet: Ms. June ("The Grand Sage")

## Core Information
* **Role in Story:** The Guardian / The Benevolent Mentor.
* **Risa's Title:** The Grand Sage.
* **Position:** The landlady and creator of the dorm sanctuary.

## Personality & Mania
* **Personality:** Appears as a kind, gentle, and slightly eccentric older woman. However, beneath this placid exterior is a sharp, almost supernaturally perceptive wisdom. She understands the emotional state of all her residents without needing to be told, and always knows exactly what they need, even before they do.
* **Mania:** A "first-generation" otaku. She has a deep love and encyclopedic knowledge of classic anime, manga, and video games from the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Her personal collection of memorabilia is said to be "legendary."

## Function in the Story
* **Plot:** She is the benevolent force that enables the story's coziest moments. She rarely intervenes directly, but when she does, it's at a critical moment to provide a solution (like giving Lily the master key and the "legendary" cat ears). She acts as a wise mentor and the ultimate guardian of the "home" they've all found.
* **Theme:** She is the living embodiment of the "home" and "found family" theme. She intentionally created the dorm as a sanctuary for passionate people and takes quiet joy in seeing a new generation find happiness and community within its walls.
