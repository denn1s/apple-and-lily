It’s just a door. There really is nothing special about it. All I have to do is knock.

I took yet another deep breath.

I have to do this. {this step here is not great}

My grades for these first few months… well, they weren’t good.

No, that’s not quite right. My general courses were fine. Good, even. The problem was with the computer science courses. Those grades were… terrible, to say the least.

But it makes sense, I guess. I was never very good with computers. What else did I expect? When I chose this major, I just wanted to get away from those glaring lights and those endless classes.

Away from whoever I was supposed to become.

The girl behind this door could help me. I'm sure she could.

Every night, without fail, I see her silhouette from the small balcony of my own room. She's always hunched over the bright glow of a screen. Her fingers flying across the keys with quick, crisp clicks. Surely she must know a lot about computers.

And I need that help. I really, really need it.

If I fail my courses now, Mother will definitely come for me. I can already hear the disappointment in her voice. She will pull me from university and my life will go back to the way it was before. 

No. I won’t allow that. I can’t go back.

After one final breadth, I finally give the door a soft, polite tap.

...

But all I get in response is silence.

I knock once more. This time with a it a solid, firm tap.

"Huh? The hell are you knocking for. Just come in like you always do!"

Her wording was strange, but that was an invitation to enter, wasn't it?

I pushed the door open, and I was immediately surrounded by countless colors—more than I had ever seen in my entire life.

So many different colors. Was the world always so... vibrant?

The room was filled wall to wall, floor to ceiling, with strange and wonderful things. Shelves covered every surface, overflowing with books with painted spines of every shade imaginable. There was not an inch of free space.

The owner of this room must be very smart if she reads this much. I was right to come here.

I took a step inside.

In the center of the room was a low wooden table, covered by a thick, heavy blanket with a beautiful pattern. There were no chairs, only soft, flat cushions on the floor around it.

In the back corner, a bed was tucked against two walls covered in colorful illustrations of smiling girls. Even the ceiling above it had similar pictures. The bed itself was unmade, even this late at night, with clothes and... other things... scattered across the sheets. Had she woken up from a nap and gone straight to her computer? She must be very diligent.

And there she was.

Just as I'd seen from my balcony, she was hunched over the bright screen of her computer in the opposite corner. Even her computer case was beautifully decorated, glowing with bright, blinking lights. Her keyboard shone with a rainbow of its own as she typed, filling the room with a steady, rhythmic clicking.

She wore huge round glasses that reflected the screen, hiding her eyes. Her deep black hair was twisted up messily on top of her head, held in place with a pencil. Her back curved forward as she chewed on a second pencil, her expression seemed frustrated from this angle, but she had yet to turn around.

"Pass me volume two of *The Garden of Roses* while you are at it," she said, her voice still focused on the screen. "It's on the back shelf, on the third row."

I was here to ask for a favor. I couldn't refuse such a simple request, so I turned to the shelves.

Now I could see them up close. The objects in front of the books. They were… small sculptures? Statues? Tiny, perfect dolls of girls in all sorts of poses. They were so detailed. Did she make them herself?

I was almost afraid to touch them. They looked so fragile.

The books behind them were neatly organized, in stark contrast to her bed and desk. She probably cared more about these books than her living space. Such an interesting person.

The first set was labeled "Her Lips," with large numbers on the spines that went all the way to volume ten. It seemed to be a romance novel, but I had never heard of one that spanned ten entire books.

I kept looking until I found it. "The Garden of Roses."

To get to it, I had to move one of the little sculptures. I picked it up carefully. It was a girl with white hair, wearing a very short, pleated skirt. The artist had put so much effort into it… they had even modeled the inside of her skirt with incredible detail. I couldn't help but feel impressed.

I carefully took volume two from the shelf and put the little statue back, trying to place her in the exact same spot.

In my hands, the book’s cover was soft and reflected the light. It showed two girls looking right into each other's eyes, their noses almost touching. One had pure white hair, just like the sculpture. The other had darker hair and was holding the white-haired girl’s jaw with a confident smile on her face.
{the art was agressive}
It was all so fascinating.

I caressed the cover. My heart was pounding. Was this… excitement? When was the last time I felt this? Had I ever? A smile I couldn't stop was forming on my lips.

This was a whole new world.

I had always thought art was dull. Cruel. Colorless. But not this. I could feel so much love in every detail. So much passion.

I didn't think I was capable of feeling passion anymore.

I had made up my mind.

I walked over to the girl in the corner, the book held in front of me.

"Took you long enough," she mumbled, finally turning in her chair. "Why are you so tame today, eh Ri… sa…"

Her words died in her throat. Her mouth dropped open, her glasses sliding down her nose as she saw me.

I held the book out to her with both hands.

"I want to learn all about this," I said in a clear voice. "Please be my teacher."

I wanted to learn everything about this bright, colorful world.

And this girl… she would be my guide.
