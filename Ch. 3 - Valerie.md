Here I was again, standing in front of her door.

A heavy feeling settled in my stomach thinking about last night. We had stayed up talking so late that she just fell asleep right on the floor. She must have been terribly exhausted, and I truly hoped she wasn't upset.

As a small apology, I brought a gift. Earlier, I found the most adorable little shop that sold a curious kind of tea. They serve it cold in a clear cup with little pearls that rest at the bottom. It seemed like a happy sort of drink; hopefully, it would be enough. She seemed to like tea yesterday. 

I gave the door a couple of quick taps and waited. She didn't answer, so I knocked again. Finally, I heard a sleepy, muffled voice grumble from inside.

"Just come in! Nobody ever knocks!"

She really must not like people knocking. I will have to remember that.

Opening the door, I found her exactly where I had left her last night: curled tightly beneath the blanket I’d draped over her. The morning light streamed through the window, and she pulled the cover to shield her face, her nose scrunched in irritation.

I should have carried her to her bed, shouldn't I? She looked so uncomfortable huddled there on the cushion.

Taking my spot from yesterday on the table, carefully, I set out our small breakfast. The cake came in a little white box, and the shop had even included tiny plates and forks. After arranging everything just so, I slid her tea and a slice of chocolate cake closer to where she slept.

She shifted, then slowly pushed herself into a sitting position. The pencil from last night was gone; instead, her dark hair stood on end, forming a wild nest that seemed to defy gravity. A bright red mark, clearly indented in the perfect shape of a pencil stood out on her cheek. She blinked, her deep brown eyes clouded with sleep, and wiped a tiny, glistening trail from the corner of her mouth as she finally looked at me. Then at the tea in the table.

The sight was so unexpectedly charming that a soft chuckle escaped my lips before I could stop it. 

Her sleepy gaze drifted from me, to the floor, then back to her tea. Her face seemed slightly flushed. I watched as she grabbed the thick, pointed straw beside her cup and, with a single, aggressive motion, stabbed it straight through the plastic lid.

_Pop._

Oh. So that’s how it’s done.

I picked up my own straw, trying to copy her, but my move was clumsy. I pushed the tip against the plastic seal, but it only bent stubbornly under the pressure. I tried again, harder, but the lid refused to give way.

"I was hoping you were a dream..." she mumbled, her voice rough with sleep.

"That's sweet, but I'm afraid I'm very real," I replied, my attention still fixed on the uncooperative cup. I stabbed at it again, and then again, with no success.

"Ugh... I think I have a headache." She sighed and held out a hand. Defeated, I surrendered my drink. With another forceful _pop_, she freed my tea and slid it back across the low table.

"Thank you," I murmured, feeling my face flush. That was harder than it looked. For some reason, she was now intently looking at the ceiling.

I moved on the cake. My slice was a beautiful creation of vanilla with swirls of pink strawberry frosting, topped with a single strawberry. After the first bite, my eyes went wide. It was heavenly. The frosting was like a sweet, fluffy cloud, and the cake itself was impossibly soft. A genuine, happy smile spread across my face.

When I looked up, I managed to catch a glimpse of the girl looking at me, before she quickly went back to picking at her own slice. I pointed my fork toward her plate.

"May I?"

She gave me a baffled look. "Uh? It’s just regular chocolate cake, isn't it?" she grumbled, but she nudged the plate my way anyway.

I leaned forward and took a tiny piece. The chocolate had a deep and satisfying flavor completely different from the strawberry. It was wonderful. Both cakes were wonderful. This whole strange, lovely breakfast was wonderful. I felt like melting on my seat. 

A comfortable silence settled between us as we finished the last of the cake. I took a cautious sip of my pretty pink drink, and something shot up the straw and popped into my mouth.

My eyes went wide. It was one of the little pearls in the drink. It was soft, but also chewy and sweet. I held it in my cheek, exploring the strange new texture with my tongue before finally chewing. It was the most amazing thing I had ever tasted. This was pure joy. 

She had to feel this too.

"These are incredible!" I said, with one of the pearls still in my cheeks. "They're sweet, but also bouncy! You have to try one." I eagerly shoved my cup toward her.

She pulled back as if my drink were a hot coal, her eyes wide with alarm. A faint blush crept up her neck as she shook her head, her gaze fixed on the wet tip of my straw.

Oh. She must not want to use my straw. That was understandable.

"It's alright! Just use your straw, then," I offered, gesturing to my cup. "Put it in here and try one. They're much better than the ones in your cup, I'm sure of it."

She shook her head again, holding her own drink like a shield. "No, thank you. I'm fine."

She was missing out. Then, a brilliant idea formed in my mind. If she wouldn't come to the pearl, the pearl would have to go to her.

I took a careful sip, using my tongue to isolate a single pink pearl at the very end of the straw. To keep it from falling, I had to keep suction, which made talking impossible.

I had to **pull steadily on the straw** so the pearl wouldn’t slip out, which left no room for a word.

"Mmmph!" I pointed from the pearl to her mouth, hoping she would understand.

Placing my hands on the floor, I began to crawl slowly around table. The straw, with its precious cargo, was extended before me like a sacred offering. My gaze was locked on hers.

She watched me, her face a mask of horrified disbelief. "Wh-what are you doing?" she stammered, scrambling backward away from the table.

"MmmMMmmph!" I insisted, continuing my slow, steady advance.

Her back hit a bookshelf with a soft thud. She was trapped. I leaned over the table, getting closer and closer, my face just inches from hers. The pearl was almost there.

Just then, the bedroom door slid open.

A new girl stood in the doorway, one hand still on the handle. She took in the scene in an instant: Karin, flushed and flattened against the wall; me, leaning toward her with a straw in my mouth. A slow, wicked grin spread across the newcomer's face. She brought a hand to her forehead in a dramatic sigh.

"Karin, honestly. What have we talked about?" she said, her voice dripping with mock disappointment. "We agreed. A sock on the doorknob. Just a simple sock. Is that too much to ask for when you have company?"

The moment was broken. Seeing my delivery had failed, I simply pulled the pearl back into my mouth and chewed. It was still delicious. I crawled back to my spot and sat down, content to watch what would happen next.

Karin’s face, which had been pale with panic, was now a deep, furious red. "Risa! It's— Look..." she sputtered, unable to form a sentence.

The new girl, Risa, held up a hand. "Say the line."

Karin slumped in defeat, burying her face in her hands. "...It's not what it looks like," she mumbled into her palms.

Risa clapped her hands together softly. Her playful gaze then slid over to me. "So," she said, looking me up and down. "Are you going to introduce me? Who's our adorable little heartbreaker?"

I looked up from my tea and gave her a polite smile. "My name is Valerie Linden. It's very nice to meet you."
