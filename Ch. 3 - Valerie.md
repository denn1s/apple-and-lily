Here I was again, standing in front of her door.

Was I too inquisitive last night? I only wanted to understand her better, but everything I did seemed to paint a new, fascinating color on her cheeks. I suppose I got a bit carried away trying to see them all. The poor thing was asleep on the floor before I knew it. She must have been terribly exhausted.

I wanted to apologize, and this morning I found the perfect way: a curious cold tea served in a tall, clear cup. It showed a lovely gradient from milky white to a soft café au lait, grounded by a bold base of perfectly round, inky black pearls. The whole thing felt like a happy composition. I just hoped it would be enough, since she seemed to like tea yesterday.

As a small peace offering, I chose the tea with black pearls for her and one with white pearls for myself. Just in case, I also got us some slices of cake.

My first few taps on the door went unanswered, so I knocked again. Finally, I heard a muffled voice grumble from inside.

"Just come in! Nobody ever knocks!"

She really must not like people knocking.

Opening the door, I found her exactly where I had left her last night, curled tightly beneath the blanket I’d draped over her. The morning light streamed through the window, casting a bright, intrusive stripe across the floor. With an irritated scrunch of her nose, she pulled the cover over her face and instantly fell lost to sleep again. She looked so uncomfortable huddled there on the cushion. I really should have carried her to her bed. Oh well.

Taking my spot from yesterday, I settled onto the cushion across the low table. Everything was just as we had left it. In front of me, a single sheet of paper rested beside a pencil. Curious, I picked it up. Her handwriting was a little messy, but the words were bold and clear.

_Ringo-sensei's Yuri Lessons._

It was silly, but it was also a bit… endearing. I couldn’t stop the small smile that formed on my lips.

My fingers found the pencil next. It was simple, but the end was decorated with an interesting pattern. Bite marks. A portrait of her frustration, perhaps? Or her focus.

My eyes drifted back to the girl curled up on the floor. Her dark hair, which had been twisted up in such a haphazard bun yesterday, was now a wonderful mess, spilling across the cushion in waves. The pencil that had served as its pin was gone. Did that one have its own little drawing of bite marks etched into its end, too?

I had thought I would never want to draw again. These past few months at university were the longest I had ever gone without it, and the freedom had certainly been a relief. But now, I felt an urge to draw the very first time.

As if sensing my gaze, she shifted in her sleep, turning her head away from me and toward the ceiling. The movement revealed the answer to the missing pencil’s whereabouts. There, imprinted on her cheek, was a fine, red line. A perfect line.

The sight was so unexpectedly charming that a soft chuckle escaped me. The sound had barely faded when my hand moved on its own…

I lost track of time. It was only when she made a sound as she began to stir that I was pulled back to the present. She pushed herself slowly into a sitting position, blinking as her dazed eyes tried to focus on her surroundings.

In a single motion, I slipped the drawing under the table's cover. "Good morning," I said softly.

Her eyes finally found me, then drifted to the tea and cake I had set out. Her dark hair stood on end, forming a wild nest that reminded me of one of those modern art sculptures that seem to defy gravity. She wiped a tiny, glistening trail from the corner of her mouth as she stared at the breakfast.

Another soft chuckle escaped my lips before I could stop it.

Her sleepy gaze drifted from me, to the floor, then back to her tea. I watched as she grabbed the thick, pointed straw beside her cup and, with a single, aggressive motion, stabbed it straight through the plastic lid.

_Pop._

Oh. So that’s how it’s done.

I picked up my own straw, trying to copy her, but my move was clumsy. I pushed the tip against the plastic seal, but it only bent stubbornly under the pressure. I tried again, harder, but the lid refused to give way.

"I was hoping you were a dream..." she mumbled, her voice rough with sleep.

"That's sweet, but I'm afraid I'm very real," I replied, but my attention was still fixed on the uncooperative cup. I stabbed at it again, and then again, with no success.

"Ugh... I think I have a headache." She sighed and held out a hand. Defeated, I surrendered my drink. With another forceful _pop_, she freed my tea and slid it back across the table.

"Thank you," I murmured, feeling my face flush. That was harder than it looked. For some reason, she was now intently looking at the ceiling.

I moved on to my slice of cake. The colors were lovely. Its frosting had a delicate tone of pink that created a soft contrast against the pale tone of the sponge. A single strawberry sat atop, bringing balance to the entire thing. The first bite was a revelation. It was heavenly. The frosting was as sweet as it looked and the cake itself was impossibly soft. A genuine, happy smile spread across my face.

When I looked up, I managed to catch a glimpse of the girl looking at me, before she quickly went back to picking at her own slice. I pointed my fork toward her plate.

"May I?"

She gave me a baffled look. "Uh? It’s just regular chocolate cake, isn't it?" she grumbled, but she nudged the plate my way anyway.

I leaned forward and took a tiny piece. The chocolate had a deep and satisfying flavor completely different from the strawberry. It was wonderful. Both cakes were wonderful. This whole strange, lovely breakfast was wonderful. I felt like melting on my seat. 

A comfortable silence settled between us as we finished the last of the cake. I took a cautious sip of my drink, and something shot up the straw and popped into my mouth.

My eyes went wide. It was one of the little pearls. It was soft, but also chewy and sweet. I held it in my cheek, exploring the strange new texture with my tongue before finally chewing. It was the most amazing thing I had ever tasted. This was pure joy. 

She had to try this too.

"These are incredible!" I said, with one of the pearls still in my cheeks. "They're sweet, but also bouncy! You have to try one." I eagerly shoved my cup toward her.

"Uh? Its fine, I got my own."

She pulled back as if my drink were a hot coal, her eyes wide with alarm. A faint blush of yet another new shade of pink crept up her neck as she shook her head, her gaze fixed on the tip of my straw.

Oh. She must not want to use my straw. That was understandable.

"It's alright! You can use your straw," I offered, gesturing to my cup. "Put it in here and try one. These are different from yours."

She shook her head again, holding her own drink like a shield. "No, thank you. I'm fine."

Did she also didn't want to put her straw in my cup? She worries too much, but she was missing out...

Then, a brilliant idea formed in my mind. If she wouldn't come to the pearl, the pearl would have to go to her.

I took a careful sip, using my tongue to isolate a single white pearl at the very end of the straw. To keep it from falling, I had to keep puling air, which made talking impossible.

"Mmmph!" I pointed from the pearl to her mouth, hoping she would understand.

Placing my hands on the floor, I began to crawl slowly around table. The straw, with its precious cargo, was extended before me like a sacred offering. My gaze was locked on hers.

She watched me, her face a mask of horrified disbelief. "Wh-what are you doing?" she stammered, scrambling backward away from the table. A brand new palette of colors flipped through her face. 

"MmmMMmmph!" I insisted, continuing my steady advance.

Her back hit the bookshelf with a thud. She was trapped. I kept getting closer and closer, my face just inches from hers. The pearl was almost there.

Just then, the bedroom door slid open.

A new girl stood in the doorway. After a moment of taking in the scene, a wicked grin filled her face. Then, with the exaggerated flourish of an actor entering stage left, she swept a hand to her forehead.

"Karin, honestly," she lamented, letting her hand slide dramatically down her face. Her voice, a stage whisper that could carry to the back row, was dripping with mock disappointment. "What have we talked about?"

She let the question hang in the air for a beat. "We agreed. A sock on the doorknob." She plucked an imaginary sock from the air, holding it delicately between two fingers. 

Tapping the invisible fabric with a scolding nail, she leaned in. "Just a _simple_ sock. Is that too much to ask for when you have... _company_?"

The moment was broken. A shame. I was so close, too. Just another inch and I'm sure a wonderful new color would have bloomed on her cheeks. 

Karin’s face, which had been pale with panic, was now raw crimson. "Risa! It's not—" She bit her lip, cutting herself off as if realizing she'd stepped into a trap. "Look, just—let me explain—"

I pulled the pearl back into my mouth and chewed. It was still delicious. I crawled back to my spot and sat down, content to watch what would happen next.

Risa stopped her with a single, raised finger, her wicked grin widening. "Ah, ah, ah. Don't improvise," she cooed. "Say the line."

A long, suffering sigh escaped Karin. She buried her face in her hands, her voice a muffled groan of absolute defeat. "...It's not what it looks like."
