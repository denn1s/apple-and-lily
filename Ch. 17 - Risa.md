I'd seen a lot in my years on the job. Thought I'd seen it all, really. The kind of things that make even the most experienced detectives go cold inside. But nothing, _nothing_, could've prepared me for what I found that November evening in room 102.

She was lying there on the carpet, face-down, one arm twisted at an unnatural angle. 

Riri-hime. I recognized her immediately.

An innocent little girl who had never hurt a fly.

The fall from the kotatsu had done a number on her. Red spread across the floor in a dark pool that caught the light from the windows. Some of it had even splattered in droplets, marking the violence of the impact.

 But what made the scene so hard to stomach was the smell. A penetrating smell that haunts everyone in my profession.  

Acrylic.

I unwrapped a lollipop. Grape. The taste did little to cut through the bitterness of the scene as I crouched beside her. Her face was still intact, a small mercy. But those big eyes now stared at nothing, and that little smile was frozen forever. She never saw it coming.

I stood up slowly, letting my eyes sweep the room. The two suspects were clammed up tight. They weren't talking to me, and sure as hell weren't talking to each other. I knew right away that it was going to be one of *those* cases. 

One of them sat on the bed, arms folded, one leg crossed just so. Her golden hair matched the white one-piece she wore proudly. Even with that stubborn pout on her face, she carried herself like royalty. I decided to call her *Princess* on a whim.

The other one, the actual owner of the room, was an old acquaintance. I call her Miss Sock-on-the-Knob, or just *Socks*, for short. She sat in her rolling chair, making a big show of keeping her eyes off Princess. She had the same posture as her visitor: arms crossed and a pout firmly in place. But the stiffness in her shoulders gave away that confidence didn’t come as easy to her.

I shifted the lollipop to the other side of my mouth.

Neither one would look at the other. Neither would speak.

Thew were close enough to fight over something this stupid, so you might think these two were dating. But no. It was worse than that.

They were idiots.

I pulled out my mental notepad. Time to get some answers.

“So…” I said, my tone flat. “Want to tell me what went down here?”

The floodgates opened.

“This wouldn't have happened if a _certain someone_ had done the dishes when it was their turn!” Socks burst out, jabbing a finger in Princess's direction without actually looking at her.

Princess's head whipped around. “Well, I _would_ have done them if a _certain someone_ had told me there wasn't going to be any water today!”

“I shouldn't have to tell you! The Grand Sage sent an email!”

“I don't check my email every single day!”

“Everyone checks their email!”

“I was _busy_!”

“Like how you were too busy painting the figure to wash the dishes yesterday?”

I pulled the lollipop from my mouth. The sweetness of this so-called fight was getting to me.

“Well, maybe if you owned more than two forks, we wouldn't be in this mess!”

Socks's face flushed red. She looked away, suddenly sheepish. “I… I never had anyone to eat with before,” she mumbled, arms crossing defensively. “Two was always enough…”

A beat of silence.

Princess's expression softened immediately. Her cheeks went pink as she tucked a lock of golden hair behind her ear, fingers lingering there. “Well… I wouldn't mind bringing more of my things over if—”

I jammed the lollipop back in my mouth.

*CRUNCH*.

I bit down. Hard. If I didn't stop their flirting now, we'd never get to the bottom of it. 

Both of them jumped, heads snapping toward me.

I pulled the stick from my mouth and tossed it in the trash. Time to establish some order.

“Ladies, ladies, please,” I said, holding up both hands.

Just like that, the two suspects were back to sulking at their respective walls. Good.

I took my time. I needed these two to cool off—in more ways than one. You can't get a clean confession when the suspects are all heated up, whether from yellin' or… whatever that other thing was. Mushy suspects make for a messy case.

I pulled a new lollipop from my pocket. Cherry. I made a point of unwrapping it slowly, letting the loud crinkle of the plastic echo in the stale air. I rolled the plastic stick between my fingers for a beat before popping it in my mouth.

“Here's how this is going to work,” I said. “I need to interview you separately. Get to the truth of what happened here.”

“That's ridiculous—” Socks started.

“Nope.” I grabbed the back of her rolling chair. “You. Bathroom. Cool off.”

Her hands flew to the armrests, but it was too late. I drove the chair to the bathroom door before she could get up.

“Risa! What the hell—”

I gave the chair one final, unceremonious shove. My old friend dropped to the floor of her own bathroom. 

“Don't come out. I'll come to you when it's your turn.”

She scrambled to her feet, indignant. “You can't just—”

I closed the door and turned back to Princess, who was still sitting on the bed, looking somewhere between amused and bewildered.

“Your turn,” I said, rolling the lollipop to the other side of my mouth. “Let's talk.”

**---SUSPECT: PRINCESS---** **TESTIMONY #1**

---

I crossed my arms and leaned against the shelf, studying the dame across from me.

She sat with perfect posture, hands folded in her lap, looking up at me with big brown eyes that could melt steel. The afternoon light caught her blonde hair in a way that made her look like something out of a painting. Innocent. Helpless.

I wasn't buying it.

This one was smart. I'd seen her work—watched her wrap Socks around her little finger more times than I could count. She knew exactly what she was doing.

“Walk me through it,” I said as I pulled the lollipop from my mouth, holding the cherry orb up to the light. “What happened today?”

She switched her crossed legs around. A calculated move, no doubt. “Well… I brought us some lunch today. A cute peach pie. I thought it would be nice.”

I twitched. Pie for lunch. Not *with* lunch. Not *after* lunch. Just… pie. But that wasn't what we were here to discuss. “Go on.”

“We were going to share it, but…” She glanced down at her hands. “We didn't have any clean knives. So we just tore it in half with our hands. Well… tried to.”

I glanced at the table. Sure enough, two halves of a pie were still in the open box.

“The halves weren't even,” Princess continued. “Mine had more peaches. Rin's had more of the crust and filling.” She paused, biting her lip. “She… she tried to give me a piece from her half. To make it fair.”

“And?”

Her cheeks went pink. She looked away, the picture of a flustered maiden. “She… She'd already taken a bite from it.”

I waited.

“I just… couldn't take it.” Her voice dropped to almost a whisper. Even her shoulders sagged with the weight of it. 

“She'd already…” Princess dramatically covered her eyes with one hand. “In her books, it always starts with an indirect k-ki…”

She stopped mid-word, presumably too flustered to finish. I studied her face. She looked genuinely flustered, to a degree. But something about the way she told it felt like she was choosing every word, every pause.

She was hiding something. I just didn't know what yet.

**---SUSPECT: SOCKS---** **TESTIMONY #1**

“—and I'm telling you, you can't trust a word that demon says!”

Interview Room A: also known as Socks's bathroom. She sat on the closed toilet lid, arms crossed tight, face flushed with indignation. I leaned against the sink, looking down at her.

She'd been going for a while now.

“A demon?” I asked for confirmation.

“Yes! Demon!” She jabbed a finger toward the door. “With those damned red eyes…”

“Uh-huh.” I shifted the lollipop. “And when exactly did you realize your dorm mate was a… ehm, *demon*?”

“Don't patronize me, Risa! I'm serious! She—”

“Alright, alright.” I held up a hand. “Let's hear your version. What happened with the pie?”

“She tried to feed me first!” Socks blurted out. “A peach. She just… held it up to my mouth like it was nothing!”

I raised an eyebrow. “And you took it?”

Her face went redder. “I… I mean—that's not the point!”

I stopped myself from facepalming. “Then, what is the point?”

“The point is she started it! I wanted to give her some of mine so she wouldn't call it unfair anymore and try to feed me more…” Socks threw her hands up. “I only took a small bite! She didn't have to make such a big deal about it. She does it all the time!”

I let the silence sit for a moment.

“So she… does it all the time,” I repeated slowly.

“Yeah! Just yesterday she—” Socks froze. Her eyes went wide. “Wait. That came out wrong.”

“Did it?”

“I meant—she's always sharing her food! That's all! It's not—we're not—”

I watched her dig the hole deeper, completely oblivious to what she was confessing to. This suspect had clearly lost all sense of reality. Either that, or she was so far gone she didn't even realize what she was saying anymore.

Classic case of someone in too deep.

“What happened after?” I asked. “After the whole pie-sharing shtick.”

“Oh.” She blinked, as if the memory pained her. “Well, I noticed she had some peach on her cheek….”

I waited.

“I just wanted to help…” Princess continued. “To clean it off for her. It seemed like the polite thing to do.”

“Uh-huh.”

“I leaned in to wipe it away.” She demonstrated with a delicate gesture, fingers barely touching the air. “I was only trying to be helpful.”

The way she said it felt far too innocent. 

“And then?” I pressed.

“And then she…” Princess paused, biting her lip. A calculated hesitation. “Well. You saw how she gets. She tried to run away, but in her panic she… she…”

She left it hanging there, with just a sad look at the broken figure on the floor.

**---SUSPECT: SOCKS---** **TESTIMONY #2**

---

Back in Interview Room A, Socks was pacing. Well, as much as you can pace in a bathroom the size of a shoe box.

“Sit down,” I said.

She sat quickly.

“Tell me about the peach incident.”

Her eyes went wide. I'd seen that look before—on witnesses who'd seen things they couldn't unsee. The kind that comes with trauma.

“She…” Socks swallowed hard. “She started moving toward me…”

“Moving how?”

“Like a predator.” Her eyes turned hollow for a moment. “On all fours, Risa. _On all fours_.”

I kept my expression neutral. Professional. “Go on.”

“Those red eyes locked onto me, and she just… started crawling across the floor.” Socks gripped the edge of the toilet seat. “What was I supposed to do? I panicked!”

“So you ran.”

“I had to! What else could I do?!” She had a faraway look. This was not the first time this happened, it seemed. “She was hunting me, Risa.”

I studied her face. The paranoia was real. The fear was real.

Whether any of it actually happened the way she described?

That was another question entirely.

“And then what happened?” I asked.

Socks's face flushed. She looked away. “I—it all happened so fast—I… I just kicked out of reflex and hit the table…”

--- 


I called them both back to the scene of the crime.

They filed in quietly. No protests, no excuses. That told me something right there.

They sat across from each other at the kotatsu, heads down, eyes fixed on the table like it was the most fascinating thing they'd ever seen. Anything to avoid looking at each other. Anything to avoid looking at the broken figure still sprawled between them.

Hopefully they both realized what they did wrong.

I paced the length of the room, hands behind my back. Piecing it all together.

My lollipop had finally run down to nothing but stick, so I tossed it and unwrapped a new one. Orange.

I rolled the lollipop to the corner of my mouth and smiled. I had all the facts now.

Two suspects. Two idiots. Both guilty of the same damn crime.

I let the silence stretch. Let them squirm.

Then I delivered my verdict.

“You two should just kiss already.”

Both heads snapped up. Both faces turned the exact same tone of red.

“_Risa!_” they said in unison.

I rolled the lollipop to the corner of my mouth. My work here was done.

Princess couldn't stop playing with her prey. And Socks kept playing hard to get. This was never going to end unless someone pushed them off the cliff.

But that wasn't my job. Not today, anyway.

I walked toward the door, then I stopped. 

“Karin,” I said, not looking back. “You're apologizing for kicking the figure.”

A pause. Then, quietly: “… Yeah. I know.”

“Valerie.” I glanced over my shoulder. “You're fixing it. Come by my place tomorrow. I'll cover the filament. Consider it a lesson in 3D modeling.”

Princess blinked, then nodded. “I—yes. Thank you.”

“Good.”

I stepped into the hallway and closed the door behind me.

It wouldn't be long before everyone in the dorm heard the sound of someone falling on the floor again. Those two never learn.

Case closed.

Well. Mostly.

One detail nagged at the edge of my mind as I walked away. A loose thread I couldn't quite tie off.

Did Karin really have a piece of peach on her cheek?

I pulled the lollipop from my mouth and tucked it back in its wrapper, sliding it into my pocket.

I'd had enough sweetness for one day, and none of it came from lollipops.
