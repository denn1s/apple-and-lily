Spread across the low table, Riri-hime waited in pieces: torso, head, arms, legs, and that paintbrush staff. A small puzzle waiting to be solved.

I picked up one of Riri-hime's legs. The thigh piece and lower leg were already separated, so I pressed them together, and they easily clicked into place with a satisfying snap. When I pulled them apart, the magnet inside gave the tiniest resistance before releasing. I pushed them back together, let them snap, and then pulled them apart again. I held the lower leg just far enough away to feel a tug, then let go. Snap. I couldn't help but smile. It was oddly delightful.

The leg separated exactly where the sculpted thigh-high stocking ended and bare skin began. There was even a slight indentation where the elastic pressed into the soft of the thigh. 

My thumb traced the stocking's edge. If this were one piece, I'd need to mask off sections while painting. But separated like this? I could paint the stocking one color and the thigh another, then snap them together. The paint wouldn't bleed and wouldn't transfer, and the seam would vanish right at the edge. 

This was its own kind of art. Not painting, not sculpture. Something in between, or perhaps both at once.

I turned the leg piece over in my hands. The tutorials I'd been watching late at night taught the basics, like reference images, extruding from a cube, and adding geometry to make surfaces smooth. Building forms from flat pieces. But none of them mentioned anything about where to split a model for printing or how to hide seams in the design itself. I could see why Risa had been struggling.

I let out a slow breath. More tutorials, then. It seemed my nights were destined to be long, split between deciphering the art of 3D modeling and… my other, more personal research.

My gaze drifted toward the door, which was still open to the hallway. Rin had been so focused on her work today that she hadn’t complained about it even once.

Small progress, maybe.

She was always like that when she wrote. Completely focused, fingers flying across the keys with only brief pauses to think. As I watched, she leaned closer to the screen, her lips moving silently. This was probably how she tested her lines.

I set the leg piece down with the others.

“Speaking of thighs,” I said, breaking the silence. “What are you writing about today?”

“Wh—what?” Rin's chair spun around. Her face was already light pink. “Today I'm not writing about—”

So _today_ she isn't writing about thighs.

“I was just wondering,” I said, keeping my voice light. “You seemed particularly focused.”

She adjusted her glasses and looked away.

“It's nothing. Just… finishing something up.”

“Ohhh, and what is it?” I asked, pressing her a bit.

“It's—it's not ready yet. Still needs editing and—”

“Then just tell me what it's about.” I tilted my head slightly. “I'm not asking to read it.”

She wouldn't meet my eyes, but I kept my gaze firm. A long moment passed until she finally let out a small, resigned sigh.

“It's… based on this series… where one character pays the other to keep her company after school.”

“Uh-huh.” I motioned her to keep going.

Her gaze met mine for an instant before moving away again.

“One of them is plain. The other dresses up a lot.” She hesitated. “So in my version, one day it rains suddenly. When the flashy girl shows up… her uniform is all wet.”

She was already speaking faster. She always got like this when she was excited.

How cute.

I rested my elbows on the table, cupping my cheeks in my hands as I leaned forward. My eyes didn't leave her face.

“And what happens then?”

“So she has to take a bath and dry her clothes at the plain girl's house, right? And when she's done, she asks to borrow the plain girl's makeup kit.”

Rin leaned forward slightly. A small grin formed at the corner of her mouth.

“But—the plain girl has a different idea. She gives her an order, because of the whole paying to keep her company thing, to put makeup on _her_ instead.”

Her hands started moving as she talked, gesturing in the air.

“So the flashy girl agrees, and at first it's normal, right? Just foundation and stuff. But then—”

Her eyes were bright now. Her usual nervousness just vanished.

This must be the real Karin.

“Then she's applying the lipstick, and the plain girl gets really mad at her because she's too obedient and—just grabs her—”

*Tell me, who hurt you?*

“—and pushes her down onto the bed!”

She gestured with both hands, mimicking the push. Even her legs kicked slightly with excitement.

Who hurt you so much that you decided you could never leave this room?

“And then—”

What made you decide this was the only safe place for all this life, all this warmth, all this passion?

Was it your family? I know what that feels like. When the people who should protect you make you lose the things you love.

“And then what happens?”

“And then she grabs the third button of her shirt and pulls—”

She made the grabbing motion, her eyes bright, her grin widening.

“—but she pulls too hard and—”

Who could have hurt this girl badly enough that she hides all this creativity and warmth behind crude words and closed doors?

“Uh-huh. And what happens then?”

Rin stopped mid-sentence. Her eyes went wide as she seemed to realize how far she'd gotten. Color flooded her cheeks.

And there it is. The door closing again.

She spun her chair back toward the desk and hunched over the keyboard.

“The rest…” Her voice was quieter now. “You're not ready for the rest.”

So I'm not ready. I could work with that.

I stood from the table and moved to the bed, sitting on its edge.

“What happens after she pulls the button, *Sensei*?” I asked, letting my fingers find the top button of my shirt.

Rin's eyes went to my hand immediately. I let it drift down to the second button. The third. Not really unfastening them or anything.

Her knuckles went white against the armrests. Her gaze flickered wildly, to my hand, to my face, then to my hand again.

Her mouth opened, then closed. Then opened again.

“Makeup!” she finally blurted out.

I waited patiently for her to continue. 

She cleared her throat and straightened in her chair, pushing her glasses firmly up her nose. There it was—the Sensei mask sliding neatly into place.

“Your next lesson,” she announced, her voice confident now. “It's about makeup.”

“But I already know how to do my makeup well enough.”

She shook her head, leaning forward slightly as she gained momentum. “Makeup is like a girl's armor. It's not just about looking good. It's about confidence.”

So we were playing with makeup today. Interesting.

I stood and crossed to where I'd left my backpack by the kitchenette. I'd started bringing it with me these last few days, just in case we ever actually decided to study. We hadn't.

“You should try to find a girl you're close with,” she continued, talking faster now. “Not me, of course, but try wearing a different kind of makeup than what you usually—”

I unzipped the front pocket and pulled out my familiar makeup bag.

“—than what you usually… w-wait.” Her voice went thin. “What are you doing?”

I returned to the bed and sat back down on the edge, setting the bag beside me. “Well, if I try to do my own makeup, it'll just end up the same as always, right?”

I unzipped it slowly.

Foundation. A compact of pressed powder. I started lining items up on the bed, one by one. A small collection of brushes.

When I glanced up, Rin had gone completely still. Only her eyes moved, following every movement of my hands.

“So I'll need your help, Sensei.”

Silence.

Her eyes went to the bed. To the makeup spread across it. Then to me. Then back to the bed.

“Why…” Her voice came out barely above a whisper. “Why on the bed?”

I paused and pointed toward the low table. Her gaze followed my finger. I watched her throat move as she swallowed. The Riri-hime pieces were still spread across its entire surface. There was no room for anything else.

I arranged the last few items on the bed, then looked up at her with my best smile.

“You'll help me, right?”

Her face cycled through a beautiful progression of colors. White to pink to red, then back to pale white again. Her mouth opened, but nothing came out.

---

She stood before me, holding a small eye shadow brush as if it were the most dangerous instrument. Her hand hovered near my face, trembling slightly.

“So… I just…” she began, her voice barely above a whisper. “This goes on the eyelid, right?”

“Powder first,” I said gently. “The little compact. Then the brush.”

She set the brush down and then picked up the compact. Her hands were shaking slightly. She dipped the new brush into the powder and leaned in.

She leaned closer.

The trembling got worse.

“Close your eyes,” she whispered nervously.

The first touch of the brush was tentative, barely there. The bristles moved in uncertain strokes across my eyelid. I could hear her breathing. Feel it, even. The bed shifted as she adjusted her weight.

My heart beat a little faster.

Keeping your eyes closed this close to someone was… something else.

The brush lifted away. A soft click as she set it down.

“That’s… probably good enough,” she said.

“Can I open them?”

“Yeah.”

I opened my eyes. She was already reaching for the foundation, unscrewing the cap with uncertain fingers.

“How much do I…?”

“Just a little. Dot it on, then blend.”

She squeezed the tube. A generous amount bloomed onto her fingertips. She froze.

“It's fine,” I said. “Just use what you have.”

She reached toward my face, steadying her trembling hand with the other. The foundation was cool against my cheeks, my forehead, my chin. Her fingertips were warm. Trying so hard not to actually touch my skin.

For a moment, I worried she could hear my heart beating.

“I think that's… it?” She wiped her fingers on a tissue and stepped back, letting out a held breath.

She'd been so nervous the whole time. Trying so hard.

“It's very cute,” I said.

She frowned. “The makeup, right?”

I just smiled.

Her frown deepened, unconvinced. “You can tell without a mirror?”

I picked up the lipstick and pressed it into her hand. “Just one more.”

She stared at it. At my lips. Back at it.

She'd been so careful not to touch me this whole time.

“Don’t…” she whispered. “Don’t move.”

I stayed perfectly still. Her hand trembled as she brought the lipstick closer. It hovered near my mouth for a full second.

When she finally moved, it took another second for it to make contact.

Her hand moved slowly, so slowly, dragging the color across my skin. She was holding her breath—I could tell… Because I was too. When she reached the corner, she paused. Steadied herself.

My heart was beating faster. I swallowed carefully, trying to stay calm.

She moved to my upper lip. As the lipstick traced the curve— 

Her finger brushed my lower lip.

It was just a touch. The slightest touch. But I felt it everywhere.

Heat flooded my cheeks. Suddenly. Fiercely. If not for the foundation she'd applied, she would have definitely seen it. 

Actually, did she see it? Please don't let her have seen it.

“There.” She capped the lipstick and set it down. “Done.”

She let out a long, relieved sigh and sat back slightly, flexing her fingers.

I could still feel it. The exact spot where her finger had brushed. Burning.

I drew in a breath. Let it out slowly.

She was wiping her hands on a tissue, just avoiding my gaze like usual.

She hadn't noticed.

Having someone else apply your makeup made you vulnerable in ways I hadn't expected. Maybe that's what the girl in her story had felt.

I took another breath. 

“Alright.” My voice came out steadier this time. “Now it's your turn.”

Rin's head snapped up. Her eyes went wide. Her face turned yet another beautiful shade of white.
