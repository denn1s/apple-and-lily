The skirt piece was surprisingly light when I lifted it, a perfect bell that held its shape even separated from the body. I turned it over, and the wide opening at the bottom showed the delicate sculpted pleats from the inside—like looking up into a tiny umbrella made up of more tiny umbrellas. It made me smile. I set it back down. Spread across the low table the rest of Riri-hime waited in pieces: torso, head, arms, legs, that paintbrush staff. A small puzzle waiting to be solved.

I picked up one of her legs. The thigh piece and lower leg were already separated, so I pressed them together and they easily clicked into place with a satisfying snap. Then I immediately pulled them apart. The magnet inside gave the tiniest resistance before releasing. I pushed them back together. Then apart again. I held the lower leg just far enough away to feel a tug, then let go. The magnet drew it back like a gentle hand guiding it home. I couldn't help but smile. It was oddly delightful.

The leg separated exactly where the sculpted thigh-high stocking ended and bare skin began. Just above that line, they'd even added a tiny garter band. There was even a slight indentation where the elastic pressed into the soft flesh of the thigh. The attention to detail never ceased to amaze me.

My thumb traced along the little belt. If this were a single piece, I'd have to mask off sections while painting, praying the colors wouldn't bleed together. But separated like this? I could paint the stocking one color, the thigh another, then simply snap them back together. The seam would be invisible, hidden right at the stocking's edge. The entire design was a conversation between sculptor and painter. How wonderfully clever.

This was its own kind of art. Not painting, not sculpture. Something in between, or perhaps both at once.

I turned the leg piece over in my hands. The tutorials I'd been watching late at night had taught me the basics: how to set up reference images, how to start with a simple cube and pull its faces outward to rough out a shape. How to add more squares and triangles to make the surface smoother. It was all about building forms from flat pieces. But none of them had mentioned any of this. I could see why Risa had been struggling.

I let out a slow breath. More tutorials, then. It seemed my nights were destined to be long, split between deciphering the art of 3D modeling and... my other, more personal research.

My gaze drifted toward the doorway, still open to the hall. Rin had been so focused on her work today that she hadn’t complained about it even once.

Small progress, maybe.

She was always like that when she wrote. That concentrated expression, the way her fingers flew across the keys, pausing only when she was thinking through a scene. Sometimes her lips moved silently, testing dialogue. Sometimes she pushed her glasses up her nose and leaned closer to the screen.

I set the leg piece down with the others. My eyes were starting to hurt from studying such small details anyway. {we need to change This line, I want to keep Lily interested in the model just for narrative support in the next scene}

"Speaking of thighs," I said to break the comforting silence we had been on for the last few hours. {thIs part could be better} "What are you writing about today?"

Rin's chair spun around. Her face was already light pink.

"Wh—what? Thighs?! Today I'm not writing about—"

So _today_ she isn't writing about thighs.

"I was just wondering what you were writing about," I said, keeping my voice light. "You seemed particularly focused."

She adjusted her glasses and looked away.

"It's nothing. Just... starting something new. Don't have much yet." {We need Karin flustered in the next chapter, so lets change this as to how she Is almost done}

"Then tell me what it will be about."

She wouldn't meet my eyes.

"It's... based on this series. Where one character pays the other to keep her company after school."

"Uh-huh."

Her gaze flickered up to mine, then away again.

"Well, one of them is really plain. The other dresses up a lot. So in my version, it rains suddenly. When the flashy girl shows up, her uniform is all wet."

She was already speaking faster. She always got like this when she was excited.

How cute.

I rested my elbows on the table, cupping my cheeks in my hands as I leaned forward. My eyes didn't leave her face.

"And what happens then?"

"So she has to take a bath and dry her clothes at the plain girl's house, right? And when she's done, she asks to borrow the plain girl's makeup kit."

Karin leaned forward slightly. A small grin was forming at the corner of her mouth.

"But—the plain girl has a different idea. She gives her an order—because of the whole money thing—to put makeup on _her_ instead."

Her hands started moving as she talked, gesturing in the air.

"So the flashy girl agrees, and at first it's normal, right? Just foundation and stuff. But then—"

Her eyes were bright now. Her usual nervousness just vanished completely.

*You must be the real Karin.*

*Tell me, who hurt you?*

"Then she's applying the lipstick, and the plain girl gets really mad at her because she is too obedient and—just grabs her—"

*Who hurt you so much that you decided you could never leave this room?*

"—and pushes her down onto the bed!"

*What made you decide this was the only safe place for all this life, all this warmth, all this passion?*

She gestured with both hands, mimicking the push. Even her legs kicked slightly with excitement.

*Was it you family? I know what that feels like. When the people who should protect you make you lose the things you love.*

"And then what happens?"

"And then she grabs the third button of her shirt and pulls—"

Karin made the grabbing motion, her eyes bright, her grin widening.

"—but she pulls too hard and—"

Someone hurt this cute girl badly enough that she now hides all of this creativity and warmth behind crude words and closed doors.

"Uh-huh. And what happens then?"

Rin stopped mid-sentence. Her eyes went wide as she seemed to realize how far she'd gotten. Color flooded her cheeks.

And there it is. The door closing again.

She spun her chair back toward the desk and hunched slightly over the keyboard.

"The rest..." Her voice was quieter now, protective. "You're not ready for the rest."

So I'm not ready.

I could work with that.


Fix this with: 
(Karin says, "You're not ready for the rest.")

**Valerie's Internal Monologue:** _So I'm not ready. But I have to know what happens next. The story was about a girl pushing the other down, grabbing the third button..._

(She looks at Karin, who is flustered but also intrigued. Valerie sees her opening.)

**Valerie's Internal Monologue:** _She won't tell me... but maybe she'll show me._

(She then stands up, walks to the bed, and her hand goes to the top button of her own shirt. She doesn't unbutton it, but maybe just lets her finger trace the edge or tug at it lightly.)

**Valerie:** "So... what happens after she pulls the button?" (Her tone is one of pure, innocent curiosity).



“Then what do I need to do to be ready, Sensei?” I asked, my voice bright with curiosity.

I stood up from the low table and crossed the short distance to her bed, sitting on the edge so I was facing her. Rin’s chair, which had been angled toward her desk, swiveled back around. 

Her eyes went wide immediately. My fingers found the top button of my shirt. It was just the first one, nothing scandalous. I slipped it free from its hole.

Rin’s eyes were fixed on the second button now. I could almost feel the heat of her gaze. I let my hand drift down, Her own hands gripped the armrests of her chair, her knuckles turning white. Her gaze was shaking now. She was looking for an escape. Any escape.

Her mouth opened, then closed. Then opened again.

“Makeup!” she finally blurted out.

She was going to think of something new, something fun and exciting, just like she always did.

She cleared her throat and straightened in her chair, pushing her glasses firmly up her nose. There it was. The Sensei mask sliding neatly into place.

“Your next lesson,” she announced, her voice confident now. “It’s about makeup.”

“But I already know how to do my makeup well enough,” I said.

She shook her head, leaning forward slightly as she gained momentum. “Makeup is like a girl’s armor. It’s not just about looking good. It’s about confidence. And presentation.”

So, we were playing with makeup today. Interesting.

I stood and crossed to where I’d left my backpack by the kitchenette. I’d started bringing it with me these last few days, just in case we ever actually decided to study. We hadn’t. 

“You should try to find a girl you’re close with,” she continued, talking faster now. “Not me, of course, but try wearing a different kind of makeup than what you usually—”

I unzipped the front pocket and pulled out my familiar makeup bag.

“—than what you usually… w-wait, what are you doing?” she trailed off, her voice laced with a smidgen of worry.

I returned to the bed and sat back down on the edge, setting the bag beside me before unzipping it. “Well, if I try to do my own makeup, it’ll just end up the same as always, right?”

I started pulling items out and lining them up on the bed beside me. Foundation. A compact of pressed powder. A small collection of brushes. Rin had gone very still, watching my every move.

“But… why on the bed?” she asked, her voice shaking slightly.

I paused my unpacking and pointed toward the low table. The carefully separated pieces of the Riri-hime figure were still spread across its entire surface. Legs, arms, head, torso. There was no room for anything else.

Her gaze followed my finger. She saw the pieces. I saw her swallow.

I arranged the last few items on the bed, then looked up at her and gave her my best smile.

“You’ll help me, right?”

Her face cycled through a beautiful progression of colors, from white to pink to red, and then back to a pale white.

---

She stood before me, holding a small eye shadow brush as if it were the most dangerous instrument. Her hand hovered near my face, uncertain.

“So… I just…” she began, her voice barely a whisper. “This goes on the eyelid, right?”

“The powder first,” I said gently. “The little compact. Then the brush.”

She set the brush down and then picked up the compact. Her hands were shaking slightly. She dipped the brush into the powder, tapped the excess off, and leaned in.

“Close your eyes,” she said.

The first touch of the brush against my eyelid was soft, tentative, as if she were afraid to press too hard. The bristles moved in uncertain strokes, as if she was afraid to press too hard. I could hear her breathing. I could even feel it. The bed dipped slightly as she shifted her weight. My heart began to beat a little faster. Keeping your eyes closed this close to someone was… something else.

When she pulled away completely, I heard the soft click of the brush being set down.

“That’s… probably good enough,” she said.

“Can I open them?”

“Yeah.”

I opened my eyes. She was studying her work, but didn't look too convinced. She reached for the foundation next.

“How much do I…?”

“Just a little,” I advised. “Dot it on, then blend.”

She squeezed the tube and a generous amount bloomed onto her fingertips. She froze. “Is this too much?” she asked, a note of panic in her voice.

That's a lot of foundation. She really wasn't used to this.

“It’s fine,” I said calmly. “Just use what you have.”

She reached toward my face, her hand trembling. She steadied it with her other hand and began to dot the cool liquid onto my cheeks, my forehead, and my chin. Her hands desperately trying their best to avoid touching my face. 

Still, her fingertips were warm, the foundation was cool. 

For a moment, I worried that she could hear my heart beating. 

“I think that’s… it?”

After a moment, she wiped her fingers on a tissue she’d pulled from her pocket and took a small step back, letting out a breath she’d been holding. 

She was so nervous... I was truly moved by how hard she was trying. 

“It’s very cute,” I said.

She frowned. “The makeup, right?”

I just smiled back.

She frowned harder. “You can tell without a mirror?”

I picked up the lipstick, pressing it into her hand. “Just one more.”

She’d been so careful not to touch me. I wondered how she would handle this. 

“Don’t…” she whispered. “Don’t move.”

I stayed perfectly still. Her hand was shaking more now. She brought it to my mouth, the tip hovering for a second before it finally made contact with my lower lip.

Her hand moved slowly, so slowly, dragging the color across my skin. 

When she reached the corner of my mouth, she paused.

My heart was beating even faster now. I had to discreetly swallow to calm myself. 

She moved to my upper lip, her brow furrowed in concentration. As the lipstick traced the curve of my lips, her finger brushed against my lower lip.

It was just a touch. The slightest touch. But I felt it everywhere.

A sudden heat rushed to my cheeks, a blush so intense I was sure she would have seen it if it was not for the thick foundation she herself had applied. Thank the gods.

“There,” she said, capping the lipstick and setting it down on the bed. “Done.”

She let out a long, relieved sigh

I could still feel it. The spot where her finger had touched. It felt like it was burning, as if it had left a mark. 

Having someone else apply your makeup… it made you feel incredibly vulnerable. I think I can understand what the girl in her story was going for. 

I released the breath I'd been holding.

Then I took a deep breath, letting it out slowly to calm my racing heart. 

After a moment, I took another breath.

“Alright,” I said, my voice finally steady. “Now your turn.”

As Rin slowly turned and her eyes widened, her face turned yet another beautiful shade of white.
