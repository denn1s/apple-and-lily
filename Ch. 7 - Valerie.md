The morning light that filled my room was a flat white that made the beige walls look even duller than usual. I sat at my desk with a heavy textbook open in front of me. The page for today was a dense block of text, followed by boxes and arrows that all looked the same to me.

_A parent class passes its attributes to a child class. The child class can use the properties of its parent, but can also have their own._

My fingers traced the arrow from the box labeled 'Parent' to the one labeled 'Child', and a bitter taste filled my mouth. But I shook my head. Focus, I told myself.

_Child classes may also override behaviors with their own..._ The word 'override' now caught my eye. If only it were that simple.

There was no point in pretending anymore. No studying was going to happen today. With a sigh, I let go of the book and watched it fall closed in front of me. The dull thud made me feel slightly better.

Pushing back from the desk, I walked the few steps to my bed and collapsed onto the neatly made covers. Rolling onto my side, my gaze fell upon the empty wall in front of me.

Without realizing it, my fingers were tracing the wall’s cool surface. Just beyond this thin barrier was a world that hummed with life. Shelves bursting with forbidden stories, colors dancing shamelessly across every surface, laughter filling the air without prejudice.

Over there, even the quiet moments felt calm, while here, each silence pressed hard against my ears.

Even painting had seemed fun in that room. A whole life had taught me it was something to be endured, yet yesterday, with their genuine excitement filling the air, it had felt different. I had promised myself I’d never touch a brush again, and still, all it took was being in the right place, with the right people.

I wonder, what was she doing right now? Was she already hunched over that glowing keyboard? Or was she still asleep, curled up on the floor like a house cat? 

Of course she had a perfectly good bed, I knew, but for some reason, my mind clung stubbornly to the one time I caught her asleep on the floor. The idea was just too amusing to let go. It made me giggle.

If it wasn't for this wall, our beds would be side by side. Tracing the cold wall once again, it felt as if I could almost reach through it.

Then yesterday came back to me, and the smile I hadn’t realized I was wearing slowly faded. I'd received compliments before, many times, but they always felt calculated. either loaded with expectations or completely hollow. Hers had been different. Genuine. And I had panicked, fleeing like some skittish stray.

If she was a house cat, content and secure in her colorful domain, then I was but a stray timidly peeking in from the cold outside.

Still, she had tried her best to give me those sincere compliments, hadn’t she? There was something touching about how hard it had been for her—the way her voice faded at the end of each attempt, as if she’d run out of courage halfway through, the way her eyes kept darting aside, afraid they might betray her, and the colors that rose in her cheeks, betraying her all the same.

If I had to give it a word, it would simply have to be *cute*.

I shook my head quickly, banishing the thought. Enough of that. It was time to get to class.

From the closet, I pulled out a simple cream-colored dress. The fabric was soft against my skin and I liked how the skirt swished playfully around my legs when I walked. A quick brush through my hair, a pair of flats, and I was ready.

I closed my room behind me and made my way down the hall. The dormitory door was just ahead. Beyond it, the lecture hall waited, and with it the professor and his endless parade of complicated words. The thought of sitting there again made my chest tighten.

My hand touched the knob, then fell away.

Does she even go to those lectures? I never did get an answer. She’s supposed to be a freshman, just like me.

I should check on her, shouldn’t I? Just to ask about her classes. And to apologize for yesterday. Yes, it’s better to apologize as soon as possible. It’s the polite thing to do. Really.

And just like that, for the first time in my life, I decided to skip a lecture.

A small act of rebellion that sent a shiver down my spine, it was both terrifying and exciting.

My heart hammered against my ribs as I hurried back down the hall with quick steps. In no time, I reached her door. Remembering her no-knocking rule, I grabbed the handle without hesitation and in a single motion pushed it open. 

And then, time stopped. 

At the low table, sitting in her usual spot, was Rin. She wasn't working or sleeping. She was eating. Or, more accurately, she _was_ eating. Now, she was simply frozen. The scene before me, a perfect masterpiece….

### **Girl with Noodles**
>
>_Oil on canvas, circa spring 2025._
>
> The portrait captures a young woman in a moment of profound surprise.
> 
> In front of her rests a simple white Styrofoam cup, from which delicate wisps of steam curl and rise, suggesting a recent preparation. The girl’s right hand is suspended mid-air, clutching a pair of wooden chopsticks. Dangling from them, caught in the space between the cup and her mouth, is a pale yellow clump of noodles.
> 
> Her mouth is slightly agape, poised to receive the meal that, due to whatever caused her surprise, might never arrive. 
> 
> A great deal of attention has been paid to the subject’s large, round glasses. They have slipped down the bridge of her nose and are rendered almost opaque by a layer of condensation from the steam, obscuring her dark eyes and adding a layer of delicate vulnerability to the piece.
> 
> But the central feature is undoubtedly the magnificent detail of the girl's hair. It stands as an impressive nest of deep black piled atop her head. A haphazard bun is held in place not by one, but by two pencils, crisscrossed like a royal sigil in a desperate, yet successful, attempt to contain the beautiful chaos. This curious crown provides a crucial vertical balance to the entire composition, drawing the viewer's eye upward.
> 
> The scene is illuminated by the soft morning light filtering in from a window behind the subject, creating a gentle halo around their silhouette and setting them apart from the room's colorful background.
> 
> The most captivating aspect of the portrait, however, is not a matter of technical skill, but of pure emotional resonance.
> 
> The subject is utterly charming.
> 

An uncontrollable sound bubbled up from my chest.

A giggle.

It was loud in the quiet room and it broke the spell. The shame, the anxiety, the carefully practiced words of apology—all of it just evaporated. All the tension I felt was gone, replaced by fond amusement that warmed me from the inside out.

I turned towards the charming subject as a big smile spread across my face.

"Could I have some?"

Rin held her pose. Smiling, I slipped into my usual spot at the low table, settling onto the cushion beside the bed.

Only then did she react, the spell finally breaking. The noodles slipped from her chopsticks with a soft slurp as they fell back into the cup. A deep blush crept up her neck, and her eyes, now clear of the steam, met mine for just a moment before darting away.

“Sure,” she mumbled at last. Pushing herself up from the table, she marched toward the small kitchen counter with mechanical steps. Her movements reminded me of the plastic model. 

My gaze drifted to the table. The robot still stood there, surrounded by the remnants of my impromptu painting station from yesterday: the cardboard palette, the single brush I had brought, and my old leather satchel, all perfectly untouched.

And yet, the water I had spilled was gone. She had cleaned the mess, but not a single one of my things. I had spent the night consumed by the worry that I had made a fool of myself, that I had risked this fragile new friendship by running away.

But she wasn’t angry. She had left everything as it was, as if waiting for me to return.

A wave of warmth washed over me, so potent it dissolved the very last of my anxiety. A genuine smile touched my lips.

I leaned forward to clean up my things. One by one, the little tubes of paint went back into my satchel, not in their proper places but simply dropped inside, clinking softly as they landed together. The brush followed, also thrown in without much thought.  

As for the cardboard palette... I folded it in half and slid it into the bag as well. There were plenty of fine wooden palettes waiting in my closet, but for some reason, I wanted to keep this one

When I finished tidying up, only the model remained on the table. Its new coat of paint was still fresh, but the surface already catched the light in a way that made it look better than before.

The kettle began to hum then, a soft sound breaking the peaceful silence.

“Where should I put this so it won’t be in the way?” I asked, glancing toward Rin in the kitchen.

She was peeling the paper lid off a new cup of noodles, her hands still a little unsteady. 

“Are you done with it? Anywhere’s fine,” she said without looking at me. “It’s actually Risa’s.”

“Risa’s?”

“Most of them are. Her room ran out of space a while ago, so all her junk ends up in here nowadays.”

The kettle clicked off, and she poured the steaming water into the fresh cup of noodles she’d set out for me, trying not to spill. Her own half-finished cup still sat on the table, chopsticks resting across the rim.

My gaze drifted to the shelves, to the models locked in their frozen battles.

“And the fight scenes?” I asked. “Are those Risa’s work too?”

She set the lid on my noodles, her fingers drumming against the counter before she finally spoke.

“…Those are mine.” She seemed almost reluctant. After a beat, she added quickly, “Risa’s the one who buys the kits. Builds most of them too, until she gets bored and just leaves them here. I just… put them together after.”

So the scenes were hers. Risa had said she was a writer, so it made sense, then. She wasn’t collecting them; she was telling their stories.

I lifted the model into my hands, holding it gently as I began to adjust its limbs. First, I raised the right arm, angling it forward to hold the broad shield, just as she had shown me. Then I bent the right knee, pressing the foot flat against the table to get the right angle, and finally, I eased the left leg back, stretching it out for balance.

Piece by piece, I set it into the stance I remembered so clearly. The _I’m not backing down_ pose.

Rising to my feet, I scanned the crowded shelves until I found a small patch of empty space. I placed the model there, facing outward into the room.

When I turned back, she had already returned to her seat. A pair of disposable chopsticks rested neatly across the paper lid in the steaming cup she had prepared for me. She gave the cup a small push, sliding it across the table to my usual spot.

Then, without a word, she picked up the chopsticks from her own half-finished noodles and resumed eating.

I lowered myself onto the cushion. For the first time since yesterday, we were both sitting together at the table. Somehow, everything finally felt as though it had settled back into place.
