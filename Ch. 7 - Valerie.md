The morning light that filled my room was a flat white that made the beige walls look even duller. I had read through the same page… what, six times now? I couldn't be bothered to keep count anymore. By now, my eyes just dragged through the words, but nothing really stuck.  
  
_A parent class passes its attributes to a child class. The child class can use the properties of its parent but can also have its own._

My fingers traced the arrow from the box labeled _Parent_ to the one labeled _Child_, and immediately, a sour taste filled my mouth. But I shook my head.

_Child classes may also override behaviors with their own_ 

The word _override_ now caught my eye. If only it were really that simple.

There was no point in pretending anymore. No studying was going to happen today. With a sigh, I released my grip on the heavy book and watched it slam shut against the desk. The dull thud felt oddly satisfying.  
  
Pushing back from the desk, I walked the few steps to my bed and collapsed onto the neatly made covers. The fabric crumpled slightly beneath me, but I didn’t care. When I rolled onto my side, my gaze drifted toward the blank wall that was right in front of me.  
  
Without realizing it, my fingers were tracing the wall’s cool surface. Just beyond this thin barrier was a world that hummed with life: shelves bursting with forbidden stories; colors dancing shamelessly across every surface; laughter filling the air without prejudice…  
  
Over there, even the quiet moments seemed peaceful. Here, silence pressed hard against my ears.  
  
Even painting had seemed fun in that room. Not once in my life had I ever thought of it that way. I’d sworn off brushes for good, yet yesterday, surrounded by those girls and their sincere excitement, it felt entirely different.  
  
I wonder, what was she doing right now? Was she already hunched over that glowing keyboard? Or was she still asleep, curled up on the floor like a house cat?   
  
Of course she had a perfectly good bed, I knew, but for some reason, my mind clung stubbornly to the one time I caught her asleep on the floor. The idea was just too amusing to let go. It made me giggle.  
  
If it weren't for this wall, our beds would be side by side. Tracing the cold wall once again, it felt as if I could almost reach through it.  
  
Then yesterday came back to me, and the smile I hadn’t realized I was wearing slowly faded. I'd received compliments before, many times, but they always felt calculated. Either loaded with expectations or completely hollow. Hers had been different. Genuine. And I had panicked, fleeing like some skittish stray.  
  
If she was a house cat, content and secure in her colorful domain, then I was but a stray cat timidly peeking in from the cold outside.  
  
Still, she had tried her best to give me those sincere compliments, hadn’t she? There was something touching about how hard it had been for her: the way her voice faded at the end of each attempt, as if she’d run out of courage halfway through; the way her eyes kept darting aside, afraid they might betray her; and the colors that rose in her cheeks, betraying her all the same…  
  
If I had to give it a word, it would simply have to be *cute*.  
  
I shook my head quickly, banishing the thought. Enough of that. It was time to get to class.  
  
From the closet, I pulled out a simple cream-colored dress. The fabric was soft against my skin, and I liked how the skirt swished playfully around my legs when I walked. A quick brush through my hair, a pair of flats, and I was ready.  
  
I closed my room behind me and made my way down the hall. The dormitory door was just ahead. Beyond it, the lecture hall waited, and with it the professor and his endless parade of complicated words. The thought of sitting there again made my chest tighten.  
  
My hand touched the knob, then fell away.  
  
Does she even go to those lectures? I never did get an answer. She’s supposed to be a freshman, just like me.  
  
I should check on her, shouldn’t I? Just to ask about her classes. And to apologize for yesterday. Yes, it’s better to apologize as soon as possible. It’s the polite thing to do. Really.  
  
And just like that, for the first time in my life, I decided to skip a lecture.  
  
It was a small act of rebellion that sent a shiver down my spine. It felt both terrifying and exciting.  
  
My heart hammered against my ribs as I hurried back down the hall with quick steps. In no time, I reached her door. Remembering her no-knocking rule, I grabbed the handle without hesitation and in a single motion pushed it open.   
  
And then, time stopped.   
  
At the low table, sitting in her usual spot, was Rin. She wasn't working or sleeping. She was eating. Or, more accurately, she _was_ eating. Now, she was simply frozen. The scene before me, a perfect masterpiece….  
  
### **Girl with Noodles**  
>  
>_Oil on canvas, circa spring 2025._  
>  
> The portrait captures a young woman in a moment of profound surprise.  
>   
> In front of her rests a simple white Styrofoam cup, from which delicate wisps of steam curl and rise, suggesting a recent preparation. The girl’s right hand is suspended mid-air, clutching a pair of wooden chopsticks. Dangling from them, caught in the space between the cup and her mouth, is a pale yellow clump of noodles.  
>   
> Her mouth is widly agape, poised to receive the meal that, due to whatever caused her surprise, might never arrive.   
>   
> A great deal of attention has been paid to the subject’s large, round glasses. They have slipped down the bridge of her nose and are rendered almost opaque by a layer of condensation from the steam, obscuring her dark eyes and adding a layer of delicate vulnerability to the piece.  
>   
> But the central feature is undoubtedly the magnificent detail of the girl's hair. It stands as an impressive nest of deep black piled atop her head. A haphazard bun is held in place not by one, but by two pencils, crisscrossed like a royal sigil in a desperate, yet successful, attempt to contain the beautiful chaos. This curious crown provides a crucial vertical balance to the entire composition, drawing the viewer's eye upward.  
>   
> The scene is illuminated by the soft morning light filtering in from a window behind the subject, creating a gentle halo around their silhouette and setting them apart from the room's colorful background.  
>   
> The most captivating aspect of the portrait, however, is not a matter of technical skill, but of pure emotional resonance.  
>   
> The subject is utterly charming.  
>   
  
An uncontrollable sound bubbled up from my chest.  
  
A giggle.  
  
The shame, the anxiety, the carefully practiced words of apology—all of it just evaporated. All the tension I felt was gone, replaced by fond amusement that warmed me from the inside out.  
  
I turned towards the charming subject as a big smile spread across my face.  
  
“Could I have some?”

  
She was still frozen. Smiling, I slipped into my usual spot at the low table, settling onto the cushion beside the bed.  
  
Only then did she react, the spell finally breaking. The noodles slipped from her chopsticks with a soft slurp as they fell back into the cup. A deep blush crept up her neck, and her eyes, now clear of the steam, met mine for just a moment before darting away.  
  
“Sure,” she mumbled at last. Pushing herself up from the table, she marched toward the small kitchen counter with mechanical steps. Her movements reminded me of the plastic model.  
  
My gaze drifted to the table. The robot still stood there, surrounded by the remnants of my impromptu painting station from yesterday: the cardboard palette, the single brush I had brought, and my old leather satchel. They were all just as I'd left them.  
  
And yet, the water I had spilled was gone. She had cleaned the mess but didn't touch any of my things. I had spent the night consumed by the worry that I had made a fool of myself, that I had risked this fragile new friendship by running away. But she wasn’t angry. She had left everything as it was, as if waiting for me to return.  
  
A wave of warmth washed over me, so potent it dissolved the very last of my anxiety. A genuine smile touched my lips.  
  
I leaned forward to clean up my things. One by one, the little tubes of paint went back into my satchel, not in their proper places but simply dropped inside, clinking softly as they landed together. The brush followed, also thrown in without much thought.  
  
As for the cardboard palette… I folded it in half and slid it into the bag as well. There were plenty of fine wooden pallets waiting in my closet, but for some reason, I wanted to keep this one.  
  
When I finished tidying up, only the model remained on the table. Its new coat of paint was still fresh, but the soft matte finish was already giving it a sense of weight the bare plastic never had.  
  
The kettle began to hum then, a soft sound breaking the peaceful silence.  
  
“Where should I put this so it won’t be in the way?” I asked, glancing toward Rin in the kitchen.  
  
She was peeling the paper lid off a new cup of noodles, her hands still a little unsteady.  
  
“Are you done with it? Anywhere is fine,” she said without looking at me. “It’s actually Risa’s.”  
  
“Risa’s?”  
  
“Most of them are. Her room ran out of space a while ago, so all her junk ends up in here nowadays.”  
  
The kettle clicked off, and she poured the steaming water into the fresh cup of noodles she’d set out for me. Her own half-finished cup still sat on the table, with chopsticks resting across the rim.  
  
My gaze drifted to the shelves, to the models locked in their eternal battles.  
  
“And the fight scenes?” I asked. “Are those Risa’s work too?”  
  
Her fingers drummed against the counter as she was seemingly deciding on her answer.   
  
“… Those are mine,” she said at last, reluctantly. After a beat, she added quickly, “Risa’s the one who buys the kits. Builds most of them too, until she gets bored and just leaves them here. I just… put them together after.”  
  
So the scenes were hers. Of course. Risa had said Rin was a writer. It only made sense that she would be the one telling the stories.  
  
I lifted the model into my hands, holding it gently as I began to adjust its limbs. First, I raised the right arm, angling it forward to hold the broad shield, just as she had shown me. Then I bent the right knee, pressing the foot flat against the table to get the right angle, and finally, I eased the left leg back, stretching it out for balance.  
  
Piece by piece, I set it into the stance I remembered so clearly. The _I’m not backing down_ pose.  
  
Rising to my feet, I scanned the crowded shelves until I found a small space. I placed the model there, angling it so its stance balanced against the surrounding clutter, as though it all belonged to a larger composition.  
  
When I turned back, she had already returned to her seat. A pair of disposable chopsticks rested neatly across the paper lid of the steaming cup she had prepared for me. She gave the cup a small push, sliding it across the table to my usual spot.  
  
Then, without a word, she picked up the chopsticks from her own half-finished noodles and resumed eating.  
  
I lowered myself onto the cushion. For the first time since yesterday, we were both sitting together at the table, and somehow everything finally felt like it had settled back into place.  
  
“Give them, like, two more minutes,” Rin said, pointing at my cup.  
  
“Thank you,” I said, offering her a polite smile. We had cake for breakfast the other day, and now noodles. Mother would have been horrified, but I could only see it as another perfect, messy, wonderful breakfast.  
  
I picked up the chopsticks she had left for me. They came in a paper wrapper that I tore open at the top, sliding the sticks out. I was expecting two separate sticks, but they seemed to be fused together at the top, as if carved from a single piece of wood.  
  
How strange. I gripped one in each hand and pulled, but they didn't budge. I tried again, twisting them this time, but they remained stubbornly connected.  
  
A loud sigh came from across the table. Rin held out her hand, palm up. Heat rose to my cheeks as I passed her the fused chopsticks. With a single, sharp _crack_, she split them perfectly in half.  
  
“How can you be so ridiculously graceful with a brush and so useless with things like these?” she said as she handed them back to me.  
  
“Thank you,” I managed, not quite meeting her eyes.  
  
The two minutes had to be up by now, so I peeled back the paper lid. Steam unfurled like a veil, scented with broth and spice. Within, the noodles had softened into a delicate lattice of pale-gold strands, suspended in the amber liquid as if arranged for a still life.  
  
“They're just cheap dehydrated noodles and seasoning,” Rin began, gesturing with her chopsticks toward my cup. “The hot water rehydrates them. You just have to—”  
  
“I _do_ know what cup noodles are, Rin,” I interrupted, giving her an indignant look. “I'm not _that_ sheltered.”  
  
She raised an eyebrow. “Says the girl who didn't know what boba tea was.”  
  
I just gave her a pout. That was a low blow. I decided then and there that I would master these chopsticks if it was the last thing I did.  
  
With an air of newfound confidence, I picked up the separated chopsticks. I held them just as I'd seen her do. I dipped them into the cup, aimed for a bundle of noodles, and pinched.  
  
They slid right through.  
  
I tried again, this time with fierce concentration. The sticks crossed awkwardly, sliding against each other as I fumbled for control. Finally, I managed to trap a single, lonely noodle between the tips. I lifted it triumphantly toward my mouth… But it wriggled free and plopped back into the cup with a tiny splash.  
  
I stared at my cup in defeat.  
  
Until a short, sharp _pfft_ broke the silence.  
  
I looked up to find Rin with her hand clamped over her mouth, her shoulders shaking with barely contained laughter. When our eyes met, she lost the battle entirely, doubling over slightly. The sound that escaped was part snort, part giggle, and all mocking.  
  
“Sorry,” she managed between breaths, though she didn't look sorry at all. “It's just… you looked so confident.”  
  
I gave her my most indignant pout, crossing my arms for good measure. She was being absolutely terrible. 

But then, a thought occurred to me, and despite my best efforts to stay offended, my expression brightened considerably.  
  
“You know,” I began, “in that book I was reading the other day, *First Blossom*?”  
  
If she was going to make fun of me, then I’d just have to make her teach me. And I already knew exactly how to ask.  
  
“There was this scene where the girls were eating with chopsticks,” I continued, my face lighting up with innocent curiosity, “and one of them shared her food with the other.”  
  
I held up my chopsticks, pointing them in her direction as I spoke.  
  
“I don't think I'll ever figure out what's supposed to be so charming about these things if I can't even hold them right.”  
  
I looked back at her hopefully. She was too kind to say no if I asked her like this.  
  
“I think you'll need to give me a lesson, Sensei.”
