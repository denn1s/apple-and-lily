The morning light that filled my room was a flat white that made the beige walls look even duller than usual.

I sat at my desk with a heavy textbook open in front of me. The page for today was a dense block of text, followed by boxes and arrows that all looked the same to me.

_A parent class passes its attributes to a child class. The child class can use the properties of its parent, but can also have their own._

My fingers traced the arrow from the box labeled 'Parent' to the one labeled 'Child', and a bitter taste filled my mouth. Giving up, I let go of the book and watched it fall closed in front of me. The dull sound it made me feel slightly better.

Pushing back from the desk, I walked the few steps to my bed and collapsed onto the neatly made covers. I rolled onto my side and my gaze fell upon the empty wall in front of me.

Before I realized it, my fingers were tracing the wall's cool surface. Just beyond this thin barrier was a world that hummed with life. Shelves bursting with forbidden stories, colors that danced shamelessly across every surface, laughter that filled the air without prejudice. There, even the quiet moments felt calm, while here, each moment of silence pressed hard against my ears.

I had fun yesterday, didn't I? I don't think I'd ever had fun painting before. I even made a promise with myself, and yet all it took was a slight push from the right person.

I wonder, what was she doing right now? Was she already hunched over that glowing keyboard? Or was she still asleep, curled up on the floor like a house cat? 

I knew she had a perfectly good bed, of course. But for some reason, my mind clung stubbornly to the one time I caught her asleep on the floor. The idea was just too amusing to let go. It made me giggle.

If it wasn't for this wall, our beds would be side by side. I traced the cold wall once again, it felt as if I could almost reach through it.

The memory of yesterday surfaced, and the smile I didn't realize I was wearing faded. She'd been so kind, hadn't she? I'd received compliments before, many times, but they always felt calculated, either loaded with expectations or completely hollow. Hers had been different. Genuine. And I'd panicked and fled like some skittish stray.

If she was a house cat, content and secure in her colorful domain, then I was but a stray timidly lurking at the edges.

Still, she had tried her best to give me those sincere compliments, hadn't she? There was something touching about how hard it had been for her. The way her voice faded at the end of each one, as if she'd run out of courage partway through. The way her eyes kept darting away as colors filled her cheeks.

If I had to give it a word... it would have to be *cute*.

I shook my head quickly, banishing the thought. Enough of that, it was time to get to class.

I moved to my closet and pulled out a simple, cream-colored dress. I liked this dress because fabric felt delightfully soft against my skin, and the skirt swished in a playful way around my legs when I moved. I changed quickly, brushed my hair, and slipped on a pair of simple flats.

After closing the door to my room softly behind me, I walked to the main door of the dormitory, my hand resting on the handle. Outside, my lecture was waiting. The thought of sitting in that hall, of hearing that professor drone on and on about parents and children, felt suffocating.

I never did get an answer. Does she even go to these lectures? She is supposed to be a freshman, just like me.

My hand fell from the doorknob.

I should check on her, shouldn't I? Just to ask about her classes and to apologize for yesterday. Yes, it's better to apologize as soon as possible, after all. It's the polite thing to do. Really. It's definitely not just a convenient excuse to skip class.
