"What is your current ETA?… Understood. Thank you."

I ended the call but kept the phone in my hand, immediately dialing the last number on my list.

“Hi, Professor Harris! It's Valerie… I'm wonderful, thank you for asking! I just wanted to let you know we're running perfectly on time. We should be arriving in about half an hour… Oh, you are an absolute lifesaver. Thank you again for arranging everything. We'll see you soon! Bye!”

Hanging up, I set the phone down and rolled my shoulders back. Everyone outside was in position. Rin was sitting stiffly on her chair, which we had pulled to the middle of the room. She was already dressed in the simple jeans and hoodie we’d picked out last night. Risa was waiting by the door, alert and ready for her next instruction.

“Risa, the box from my room, if you would,” I said. She gave me a sharp nod and disappeared down the hall.

With that, I knelt in front of Rin so we were at the same height. I ran through the final checklist in my mind. Her clothes were comfortable and simple. Her makeup was minimal. Her hair was neatly pulled back and secured. Everything was chosen to help her blend in, but also for her to feel at ease.

{option 1: Her hands were clenched in her lap, shoulders tight with tension, but her eyes stayed fixed on mine without wavering.}
{option 2: Her hands, clenched tightly in her lap where trembling. Her shoulders were tight with tension. Even her jaw was clenched tight. But even then, her eyes stayed fixed on mine without wavering.}
She was afraid—anyone could see that—but she was here anyway, dressed up and ready to face her first day back on campus after six months. That took real courage, and the least I could do was match it with preparation.

"Are you ready?" I kept my voice calm.

She managed a small, stiff nod.

"Alright, one more deep breath." I waited until I saw her shoulders rise and fall. "Remember the plan. We just need to get through Math, English, and Chemistry. Back-to-back, but you'll have a classroom all to yourself. Three hours total." I kept my voice as even and gentle as I could. "We do this once, and then it's over. All the other courses have projects instead of finals, and we can finish those from here."

She looked straight through me. "Y-You really don't have to do all of this for me…" she murmured as her fingers knotted together.

I glanced around the room. The colorful spines stacked on shelves, the smiling posters brightening the walls, the warm table in the middle. She'd built this space carefully. It was her one corner of the world where she could exist without fear, without judgment. Her sanctuary, her safe haven.

Of course she didn't want to leave this one room.

I understood.

Because I was the exact same.

"Rin," I said softly, meeting her eyes again. "Helping you get out there... it helps me breathe too."

Just then, Risa returned, holding a white cardboard box.

Rin looked up at it warily. "What's that?"

"Your last piece of armor." I said with a firm smile as I got up. 

Before she could ask any more questions, my phone buzzed on my hand.

I met Rin's gaze.

"It's time."

I waited at the dorm's front door, watching the quiet hallway behind me.

Risa stood just outside Rin's doorway, backpack in hand, already in position. From here, I could see Rin take one steadying breath before stepping out into the hall.

Her head stayed up and her steps were even. No hesitation. No freezing. All those practice runs had paid off—this part, at least, she knew.

When she reached me, she stopped. Risa closed the distance and quietly helped slide the backpack straps over Rin's shoulders.

"Thank you, Risa," I said, turning to her. "Could you close the doors when we leave? Both hers and this one."

Risa gave me a playful salute. "As you command, your highness."

I smiled despite myself. I knew she was keeping things light for Rin's sake.

"I'll call when we're back. Please open them then."

With a final nod, Risa stepped back, leaving just the two of us at the threshold. We'd practiced everything up to this moment. Everything after this was the real deal.

"You can call this off at any time," I said, keeping my voice even. "Just say the word."

Rin took one more deep breath.

"I'm ready," she said, her voice quiet but steady.

I stepped back, giving her space. She needed to be the one to open the door. 

Her hand reached for the handle and pulled it open.

Bright light flooded the entryway. She flinched, turning her head away for a second before slowly looking back, letting her eyes adjust. I waited, counting to five in my head, until her breathing steadied.

I finally opened the white box. These were the best noise-canceling headphones I could find. 

Stepping closer, I reached up and gently brushed a strand of dark hair back from her cheek, tucking it behind her ear. She didn't flinch. Any other day she would have, but today she was too focused on what lay ahead.

I settled the headphones carefully over her ears, my hands framing her face as I adjusted the band. My fingers lingered there for a long moment, not to soothe her, but for my own sake {to calm my own nerves?}. 

Her wide eyes held fear, yes, but also a breathtaking determination.

I held her gaze and gave her a single firm nod. _You can do this._

We'd gone over the plan a dozen times. She knew I'd be waiting at the car after this.

Taking a deep breath of my own, I stepped outside first.

The car was right there, pulled as close to the entrance as physically possible. I'd asked for that specifically. 

It was my sister's car... which meant I would inevitably owe her a favor, a thought I truly disliked. I could already hear her voice, that sweet but sharp tone she used when reminding me of even the smallest debt. The last time I'd ridden in this car had been to some gallery opening she'd dragged me to. Before that, it had been a charity preview where I'd spent the entire evening wanting to disappear.

But it was the only car I knew with enough space inside and dark tinted windows. It would help Rin.

I would deal with my sister later.

It was less than ten steps from the dorm entrance. For her, it must have felt like miles.

Rin stepped through the doorway, head down, eyes fixed on the concrete path in front of her.

_Come on. You can do it._

One step. Then another.

_That's it. Keep going._

Her hand came up, gripping the strap of her backpack. Three steps. Four.

_Almost there._

I could see sweat beading on her forehead. Five. Six. Seven.

_You're doing it._

Eight steps. Nine.

_Just one more._

She reached out, her palm finding the car. She stopped, other hand pressing flat against her chest as she let out a long, shaky breath.

I wanted so badly to pull her into a hug, to tell her how incredible she was. But I held myself back. She needed to feel this. She needed to know she'd done this herself. Because she had.

I gestured to the open door. She looked at the dark interior, then back at me, and gave a single nod before climbing inside.

I followed, pulling the heavy door shut behind us.

I took the seat across from her, not beside her, giving her the space she needed. Rin sat perfectly still, hands clenched in her lap.

Then, as if on cue, we both sank back into our seats at the same time.

The tension I'd been holding in my shoulders finally released. I let out a breath I hadn't realized I'd been holding. {a bit cliche}

Rin opened her eyes and looked at me. I looked back at her.

For a moment, neither of us said anything. Then, quietly at first, she started to laugh. I couldn't help it. I laughed too.

The knot in my chest loosened just a little. We'd made it this far.

---

Rin sat very still, eyes opening and closing as the car pulled away from the curb. Her hands were still clenched in her lap, but they weren't shaking. She wasn't frozen. 

Good.

After a minute, she reached up and slowly pulled the headphones off, letting them rest around her neck. She looked around the interior. At the leather seats, the tinted windows, the polished wood trim.

"Is this... a limousine?" she asked, her voice hushed.

I glanced around. "I'm not sure? It's not as long as the ones on television." My mother and sister claimed they needed the space for gowns that wouldn't fold well, but I'd never worn anything like that. "Never mind that. How are you holding up?"

"Better than expected, actually," she admitted, holding the headphones carefully. "These really helped. I should get a pair of my own."

"You can keep those," I said. "I got them for you anyway."

She immediately started shaking her head, holding them out slightly. "I can't take these. They must have been expensive—"

"It's fine," I interrupted gently. "I can't use them myself. I tried noise-canceling headphones once and they just made me dizzy."

Rin hesitated, then slowly set them back in her neck. "Lily... this is so much," she said, sounding overwhelmed. "The car, the headphones, the plan... I don't know what to say."

A smile tugged at my lips. "Oh! I've read this line before. In one of your manga, actually."

Rin blinked, the anxiety in her eyes fading into confusion.

I cleared my throat, sitting up straight and adopting a slightly formal tone. "At times like this," I announced, fighting to keep my face straight, "you should just say *thank you.*" 

That was so cringy... The corner of my mouth twitched despite my best efforts.

Rin stared at me, expression completely blank. 

Then, a surprised laugh burst out of her. It was a real laugh, light and genuine, breaking all the tension that had been building.

I lost it. I couldn't help myself and I started laughing too, covering my mouth with one hand. It was ridiculous. The whole thing was ridiculous. But it had worked.

"Thank you," she said, still smiling. "I mean it." She shook her head, her smile turning wry. "Where did you even read that cheesy line?"

"I think it was... _Starlight Telepathy_?" I said, trying to remember. "The one where the girl has to touch the other's forehead to read her mind."

"Oh, that one?" Rin's expression immediately turned almost scholarly. I watched her shoulders ease down. "It started strong, but I have no idea where it's going anymore. I think I only have the first volume."

Perfect. She wasn't looking at the windows.

"I really like the art, though," I said earnestly. "Especially the night scenes. The way the stars reflect in their eyes—"

"Yeah, the art is good," Rin interrupted, crossing her arms and leaning back against the seat. "But it needs a good story to carry it through. Otherwise it's just pretty pictures."

I felt a small pout forming. "But the emotions in those panels are wonderful! Especially during the telepathy scenes."

"Still," she argued, "the words shouldn't need the pictures to do all the work."

I crossed my own arms, matching her posture. "Isn't the art the whole point of a graphic novel? Without the art, I might as well just read a regular novel."

Rin looked at me, a small smirk touching her lips. "You know what? I do need to get you to read some actual novels. Maybe that'll be my next lesson."

_Next lesson._ She was already thinking ahead, planning beyond today. My chest felt lighter.

I uncrossed my arms and gently kicked at her shoe with my own. Just a light, playful tap. "We'll see about that, *Sensei.*"

Just as she was about to reply, the car slowed to a stop.

Wait. Already? 

I blinked, momentarily disoriented. The distraction had worked so well I'd lost track of time myself. 

.. Or maybe I'd just genuinely enjoyed our little argument.

I looked out the window. We were here. Building J, where Professor Harris was waiting. I'd asked the driver to pull up as close as possible, right to the building's main entrance, but there was still a walk ahead. A long, open walkway from the car to the doors, and then another hallway up to the classroom. Longer than the one at the dorm, and far more exposed.

It was time for the final part of the plan.

---

I opened my door and stepped out first.

The parking lot was mostly empty, just a few scattered cars. In the distance, I could see a few students, but they were too far away to matter. I took a deep breath, trying to calm the sudden hammering in my own chest. Whatever I was feeling, it was nothing compared to what she must be going through.

I turned back to the car. Rin was still sitting inside, a shadow in the safety of the dark interior.

I stepped closer to the open door, bent slightly at the waist, and extended my hand, palm up. 

I held it there, perfectly still. Unwavering.

Rin's eyes went wide and fearful, fixed on my outstretched hand. "W-what are you doing?" she stammered.

I didn't move. I just held her gaze. "You know what I'm doing."

She swallowed as recognition flashed in her eyes. "I know..."

"You know why I'm doing it."

"I know..."

There was no backpack between us this time, no lousy excuses. 

"Rin," I said. "We'll walk together. You can look down if you need to. I'll guide you."  I offered my hand to her once again. "I won't let go, no matter what. I promise."

And I meant every word. No matter what happened, no matter who saw, I would not let her go.

A long moment passed. Then, the corner of her mouth twitched upward. It was the smallest, most fragile smile.

"And where did you read *that* cheesy line?"

Relief flooded through me, and I couldn't help but smile back. 

"I made it up."

She reached out and placed her hand in mine. The warmth of it flooded through me, chasing away every doubt and every fear I held. This—right here—was worth protecting.

--- 

Before she moved, Rin used her free hand to pull her hood up, letting it shadow her face. Then she lifted the headphones from around her neck and settled them over her ears, sealing herself away. She looked at me, took one visible breath, and stepped out of the car.

Her grip on my hand immediately tightened and her free hand came up to clamp onto my arm just above the elbow, holding on with both hands now.

The pressure was intense, her fingers digging into my skin, but I wouldn't let go.

"One step at a time," I murmured, though she probably couldn't hear me through the headphones.

We moved forward. Away from the car and onto the open parking lot. Finals week meant the campus was quieter than usual, so most students were either finished for the semester or hidden away studying. A small mercy. I wasn't sure how I'd explain the desperate way Rin was clinging to me otherwise.

_Just one step. Then another._

Her head stayed bowed, eyes fixed on the ground.

We reached the main walkway. Thankfully, this wasn't a large university, just a few scattered buildings connected by a few concrete paths. I liked how the vegetation framed the paths. Tall trees formed a partial canopy overhead, and the gardens on either side were lush and green. Pretty. Peaceful, even. I wished Rin could see it, but her eyes never left the floor. That was fine. It was what she needed right now.

As Building J loomed closer, her grip tightened again, fingers digging in so hard I almost winced. It hurt now. But I'd made a promise.

I lifted my free hand and gently covered her fingers where they clutched my arm. My thumb traced her knuckles.

_Everything is going to be okay._

We passed through the automatic doors into the main hallway. A few students were scattered at tables or moving between classes. I caught sight of a girl from one of my lectures. Her eyes went wide when she looked at me. I gave her a polite smile and a small wave, then kept walking.

It seemed I'd have some explaining to do after all.

I wondered if Rin ever had the chance to meet any of our classmates. I knew she'd come to class for the first few days of the semester, but I couldn't recall ever seeing her in any of our lectures.

_One step. Another._

Then we were there. Door 107.

I stopped in front of it and pushed the door open with my free hand.

Leaning in close, I brought my face right up to the side of her head, near the edge of her headphones.

"We're here," I whispered, letting the quiet pride I felt fill my voice. "You made it."
