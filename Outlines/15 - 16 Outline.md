### **Scene 2 – Cheating with AI**

- Valerie recalls, in passing, how she coaxed Karin into the room earlier that morning — a small milestone of progress.
- They move onto the bed with Valerie’s laptop. 
- Karin starts testing the waters with their new program, she notes the text input and where the code is shown. She tries a simple hello world program. 
- Valerie says she wants to "improve it" and adds some emoji hearts the output. 
- Karin sighs and suggests they focus on their actual assignment. She asks Valerie what the homework is. 
- It is a simple text‑to‑speech program
- They use Risa’s AI assistant → it completes the task instantly.
- Karin tests it by having it read some boring line. (just hello world? but in voice?)
- Then Valerie takes the laptop and changes the program but doesn't tell karin how. She should say she wants to "improve" it
- Valerie proposes they use the text to speech to say something nice about each other
- She makes it say something innocuous like how she looks fantastic in that gym outfit (Lily actually only wrote she looked nice, maybe she could blush a bit at the unintentional compliment.)
- Then karin tries to type that Lily's are nice, and the text to speech says that her ayes are the most beautiful eyes she has ever seen. 
- Karin blushes and Valerie laughs and she shows them the code and how she changed it (I want you to change the program so that it over blows any sentence it receives)
- Then karin pokes Lily this time and Lily squeals 
- Valerie gets a mischievous idea and types the remembered fanfic line from Karin’s story.
- The computer reads it aloud → Karin freezes → tension spikes.
- Awkward silence, brief apology, emotional deflation.
- Ends subdued but intact, setting tone for vulnerability.

### **Scene 3 – The Quiet Conversation**

- Still in Valerie’s room, mood slowed and peaceful again.
- Karin resumes coding while Valerie lounges on the bed; ambient sounds fill the space.
- Casual curiosity: Karin asks about Valerie’s school life
- Valerie answers lightly. It was an ordinary all-girl's school. Nothing ever happened, it was boring. 





in the second half, we can have Karin ask why Valerie decided to go for computer science if she doesn't care. 


- **Scene 4: The Flip Scene (The "Yuri-sensei" Gambit).**
    
    - After the conversation, they realize they've spent the whole time procrastinating. As a last-ditch effort, Valerie playfully declares that a formal "lesson" is needed and dubs herself "Yuri-sensei."
        
    - To complete her new persona, she says she needs glasses. The chapter ends on the action of her playfully snatching Karin's glasses from her face.
        

**Chapter 16: An Unfocused Lecture (Karin's POV)**

- **Scene 1: The "Glasses Gag."**
    
    - The chapter opens with Karin's world dissolving into a blur. The main comedic set piece unfolds with the misinterpreted instructions ("Move your legs!") and the misunderstanding about the Riri-hime model.
        
- **Scene 2: The "Classes Review."**
    
    - After the chaos, "Yuri-sensei" finally conducts her "lesson." They go over their subjects. From Karin's POV, we get her internal monologue about how much Lily has been helping her with worksheets and her growing anxiety about the in-person finals. This is where we see her gratitude and her perspective on their academic partnership.
        
- **Scene 3: The Small Victory.**
    
    - To close the chapter, they order food. Karin, feeling a quiet sense of partnership, volunteers to go get the delivery from the dorm door again, alone. It's a small, successful repeat of her victory from Chapter 14, showing her progress is sticking.
