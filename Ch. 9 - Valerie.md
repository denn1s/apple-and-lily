A couple of weeks had passed in comfortable quietness. My mornings were much the same as always, but my afternoons had taken on a rhythm of their own. The steady clicking of a keyboard, to be precise.

I walked over to one of the shelves, letting my fingers trail across the colorful spines. _On the Battlefield_. _The Saintess's Secret_. _I Can't Believe My Childhood Friend is a Magical Girl!_ Each title was a tiny promise of adventure. This was a library of secrets, and I had been granted unlimited access. Warmth always spread through my chest when I stood here.

My eyes caught on a particularly striking cover. The contrast was enchanting: a girl in a school uniform staring out at a vast ocean, while a monstrous fox loomed behind her. The colors were loud, the whole scene wonderfully chaotic.

Without a word, Rin gently took the book from my grasp and slid it back into its place. Her eyes scanned the rows, then she selected another volume and pressed it firmly into my hands. Standing here felt like discovering a new color every day.

I gave Rin a look as I shaped my lips into my most deliberate pout. But she just grunted once and returned to her desk. The moment she turned away, my feigned sulk dissolved as I looked down at the new cover. Two girls on a bicycle, floating through a sky filled with fluffy white clouds. A genuine smile touched my lips as I made my way back to my seat.

Back on my cushion, I picked up my mug. The green tea was still warm, its gentle aroma drifting up as I raised it to my lips. I took a sip, savoring the slightly bitter taste I had somehow grown fond of. When I lowered the mug, my gaze fell on the poorly drawn blue cat decorating its side, staring back at me with a completely vacant expression.

"Rin?"

"Hm?" she answered without turning around.

"What's the story behind this little one?" I asked, holding the mug up slightly so she could see it in her periphery.

She glanced over her shoulder. "The one in your cup? No story really. It's a cheap knockoff of some old cartoon. Just bought it 'cause it looked funny."

A soft laugh escaped me. Of course. She didn't buy the cup because it was some valuable collectible, or because it was illustrated by some famous artist. No, it just looked _funny_.

I settled my back against the side of her bed, the cushion soft beneath me. Drawing my knees up, I let my shins rest lightly against the edge of the table and opened the book across my lap. In the background, the quiet clicking of her keyboard filled the silence like distant rain. Everything felt perfectly, peacefully in place.

---

The low rumble of her rolling chair told me it was time. Rin pushed back from the desk, letting the chair glide just a few inches as she rose to her feet. She began to pace the length of the room, following a predetermined path that gave me a perfect view from my seat.

*And so it begins. The curtain rises on her daily little play.*

I carefully placed a makeshift bookmark between the pages, closed the book, and set it gently aside. Picking up my mug of green tea, I cradled the last of its warmth in my hands and gave the scene my full attention.

Rin's arms were crossed tightly as she paced, her gaze fixed on the floor. Her right hand came up to her chin, thumb and forefinger stroking an imaginary beard in deep contemplation.

I always enjoyed trying to guess which opening she would choose. Some days it was the chin-stroke; other times she would push at her glasses, rubbing her eyes with frustrated energy. They were both fine choices, but my favorite was the third option, when she scratched the back of her neck with that sheepish little motion.

Then, right on cue, came the familiar gesture that marked the second act. Her hand found the side of her head, fingers diving into the tangle of dark hair to scratch at her scalp in rapid strokes. What followed was the part I always waited for. The movement, without fail, sent a single pencil tumbling from her improvised bun to the floor below. I kept waiting for her to notice one day, but she never did, lost in her creative struggle as she was. 

Now for the finale. It always had one of two endings. If inspiration struck, she would make a tiny fist, tap it decisively into her open palm, and hurry back to her desk. I would have to order us lunch in that case. If not, she would let out a groan, collapse onto a cushion at the table, and offer to buy lunch herself after a couple of minutes.

She stopped pacing and stared at the open doorway. A long, dejected sigh escaped her.

Ah. Or, I suppose, there was the new third ending she had added to the performance recently.

"Lily," she said, her voice heavy with resignation. "I keep telling you to close the door."

"But the air in here gets so stale," I replied in a light tone. "It cannot possibly be good for your skin."

She simply shook her head, not bothering to argue. She walked toward the door, her hand outstretched to finally slide it shut.

"Oh! Ringo-sensei!" Risa's voice echoed from down the hall. "A little help out here? I can't get all this in one trip!"

Rin stopped cold, her hand hovering inches from the doorknob. Her shoulders went rigid, her entire body freezing in place.

Before the silence could stretch for even a second, I was on my feet. I glided past her in a single motion.

"I'll get it."

I turned back slightly, offering her a small smile.

"Could you hold the door for us?"

A moment later, I returned with two bags of what appeared to be paints. Risa followed right behind, carefully carrying a large cardboard box as if it held something fragile. We made our way past Rin and into the room.

Risa placed the box gently in the center of the table. I set my bags down beside it. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Rin shake her head once. A hand came up to rest on her chest for a moment, and she let out a steadying breath before moving past Risa to settle into her usual spot at the head of the table.

“So Risa,” she began, her voice even again. “Is this why you haven’t been coming around lately?”

“Mhm,” Risa hummed, nodding. “Had to call in some favors. Princess, any guess what this is?” She gestured between my bags of paint and her mysterious box.

“It looks like acrylics and primer,” I observed. “Are we working on another model?”

“Something like that!” Risa chirped. “Need anything else from me?”

"My old brushes should do fine," I said, thinking of the oil paints they were designed for. "Though they will be troublesome to clean." Besides those, I would probably need varnish to seal the final coat, and perhaps some thinner if these acrylics were too thick for detail work, but that could wait. "I'll have to see how the paint applies first."

"Excellent!" Risa beamed, placing her hands on either side of the box. "Because..." She paused for effect, then lifted the box with a flourish, like a magician revealing their final trick. "This is a Garage Kit!"

My breath caught. Standing on the table where the box had been was a figure, assembled from what must have been dozens of smaller pieces. They were all cast in the same pale, white plastic, fitted together so perfectly that the seams were barely visible. The color reminded me of the countless plaster statues I had been forced to sketch in my youth, but this was different. It *felt* different. Those statues were exercises in precision, with every muscle and fold of fabric carved with painstaking accuracy. This sculpture, however, wasn't concerned with anatomy. It prioritized feeling. Every line was sculpted to convey a personality, to tell a story. In that moment, I understood why Rin filled her shelves with these models.

It was the statue of a little girl, posed with a cheerful confidence that made her seem almost alive. Every line of the sculpture was soft and round, from the impossibly full curls of her hair to the puffed shoulders and the wavy hem of her wide skirt. The design created a wonderful sense of playful volume, as if she were a cloud given human form.

In her hand, she held a long staff topped with a flourish shaped like the bristles of a paintbrush. The irony was almost painful; the very instrument of my old life, re imagined here as a source of magic and joy. Her smile was wide and completely unguarded, an expression of impossibly pure delight that my tutors would have dismissed as nonsense.

Rin leaned forward, her eyes bright with a rare spark. “Oh! You got an unpainted one?”

“Yup!” Risa said proudly. “It was not easy to get, let me tell you.”

"Should I go get my brushes, then?" I asked, trying to keep my tone even.

"I love the enthusiasm, Princess!" Risa laughed. "But there's no hurry. I'm giving this to you. You can take all the time you need with it."

I stared at the figure, then back at Risa. "But... aren't these rare?"

"Meh," she said with a wave of her hand. "I give stuff to Ringo-sensei all the time." She grinned, tapping the figure’s base. "Besides, this is a model of the one and only Riri-hime! It's only right that the 'Princess' herself should have it."

My own personal Riri-hime. This was a blank canvas. A three-dimensional canvas, free of any rules or expectations. A flicker of something rose in my chest, but I pushed it down immediately. It was just a toy. A project. Nothing more.

Rin, however, was giving Risa a suspicious look. “But all of those are pre-painted sets, aren’t they?” she pointed out. “You’re scheming something.”

A wicked grin spread across Risa’s face. “Hehe! You catch on quick.”

She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “My evil plan is simple! Once Princess here gets a feel for how these kits are put together…” She paused dramatically. “That’s when we move to the next phase!”

“Which is what?” Rin asked, raising a single eyebrow. 

“We *print* them!” Risa declared, her voice returning to its usual cheerful volume.

Print them? Like with a printer? I tried to mimic Rin’s questioning expression, but my eyebrows refused to cooperate. Both of them shot up, or neither moved at all.

"Didn't we try that already?" Rin countered, her eyebrow still raised. "Even with the store-bought 3D models, we could never make any adjustments."

She glanced over at me. I was still struggling, trying to solve a complex puzzle with my face.

She let out a soft sigh. "The files always seem to need some kind of tweaking before they'll print properly," she explained. "But we never figured out how to do it."

I finally gave up and simply used my index finger to push one of my eyebrows up, holding it in place as I tried to look doubtful.

"Exactly," Risa jumped in, pointing at Rin. "If we try to print them as-is, they'd either collapse or come out looking like melted plastic. We need someone who can actually sculpt."

Risa’s smile widened, showing her teeth. She threw an arm around Rin’s shoulders, yanking her into a huddle that was still perfectly audible from where I sat. I let my face relax and calmly took a final sip of my now-cool tea.

“Sure, Sensei, we couldn’t do it before,” Risa whispered conspiratorially. “Because neither of us were… *artistically inclined*.”

She glanced over at me, and I gave her a polite little wave.

"Oh!" Rin's eyes widened as the realization dawned. She pulled away from Risa and sat back, her expression thoughtful. A moment passed. Then, her right hand clenched into a small fist and tapped firmly into the open palm of her left. She had an idea.

In a flash of movement that caught me completely by surprise, she threw an arm around my shoulders, pulling me into a huddle of our own.

Oh! I’m finally part of one!

But sadly, my delight lasted only a fraction of a second. I saw the raw panic flash in Rin's eyes as she registered what she had just done. A lovely pale red began to creep up from the collar of her hoodie. She started to pull her arm back but stopped herself midway. She was probably worried about what I would think if she pulled away so suddenly.

And just like that, she was trapped. {She had trapped herself?}

Her hand now hovered just over my shoulder, not quite touching, not quite withdrawn, suspended by her own anxieties.

“S-so… ehm…” she stammered. “Y-you know how we haven’t been able to… to s-study? Like at all?”

Our deal. We had promised to help each other, but the textbooks remained unopened on my desk. My grades were still quite terrible.

I nodded, my cheek now less than an inch from hers.

“W-well,” she continued, her eyes darting everywhere but at me. “We… I m-mean, you… you should ask Risa! For help! In e-exchange for… m-modeling for her.”

She knew she had brought this on herself, yet she was trying so desperately to play it cool. The fine beads of sweat on her brow gave her away, if her shaking voice wasn't enough of a clue. How cute.

Since her gaze was stubbornly fixed away from me, I leaned in a little closer, my lips almost brushing against the delicate shape of her ear.

“I love it.” I whispered.

A small yelp escaped her. She launched herself backwards, scrambling away until her back hit the far wall of the room, her face a delightful, deep crimson.
