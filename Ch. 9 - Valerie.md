A couple of weeks had passed in comfortable quietness. My mornings were much the same as always, but my afternoons had taken on a rhythm of their own. The rhythmic clicking of a keyboard, to be precise.

I walked over to one of the shelves, letting my fingers trail across the colorful spines. _On the Battlefield_. _The Saintess's Secret_. _I Can't Believe My Childhood Friend is a Magical Girl!_ Each title was a tiny promise of adventure. This was a library of secrets, and I had been granted unlimited access. Warmth always spread through my chest when I stood here.

My eyes caught on a particularly striking cover. The contrast was enchanting: a girl in a school uniform staring out at a vast ocean, while a monstrous fox loomed behind her. The colors were loud, the whole scene wonderfully chaotic.

Without a word, Rin gently took the book from my grasp and slid it back into its place. Her eyes scanned the rows for a moment before she selected another volume and pressed it firmly into my hands.

Well, perhaps my access was not exactly *unlimited*.

I gave Rin a look as I shaped my lips into my most deliberate pout. But she just grunted once and returned to her desk. The moment she turned away, my feigned sulk dissolved as I looked down at the new cover. Two girls on a bicycle, floating through a sky filled with fluffy white clouds. A genuine smile touched my lips as I made my way back to my seat.

Back on my cushion, I picked up my mug. The green tea was still warm, its gentle aroma drifting up as I raised it to my lips. I took a sip, savoring the slightly bitter taste I had somehow grown fond of. When I lowered the mug, my gaze fell on the poorly drawn blue cat decorating its side, staring back at me with a completely vacant expression.

“Rin?”

“Hm?” she answered without turning around.

“What's the story behind this little one?” I asked, holding the mug up slightly so she could see it.

She glanced over her shoulder. “The one in your cup? No story, really. It's a cheap knockoff of some old cartoon. Just bought it 'cause it looked funny.”

A soft laugh escaped me. Of course. She didn't buy the cup because it was some valuable collectible or because it was illustrated by some well-known artist. No, it just looked _funny_.

I settled my back against the side of her bed, the cushion soft beneath me. Drawing my knees up, I let my shins rest lightly against the edge of the table and opened the book across my lap. In the background, the quiet clicking of her keyboard filled the silence like distant rain. Everything felt perfectly, peacefully in place.

---

The soft rumble of her chair told me it was time. Rin pushed back from the desk, the wheels carrying her just a little before she rose to her feet. Keeping her eyes on the floor, she began pacing the room, tracing the same path as always. From my spot at the table, I had the perfect view.

*And so it begins. The curtain rises on her daily little play.*

I slipped a folded scrap of paper between the pages, closing the book with care before setting it neatly aside. Lifting my mug of green tea, I held on to the last of its fading warmth and gave the scene my full attention.

Rin’s arms were crossed tightly as she paced, her gaze fixed on the floor. Her right hand came up to her chin, with her thumb and forefinger stroking an imaginary beard in contemplation.

I always enjoyed guessing which opening she’d choose. Some days it was the beard stroke; other times, a frustrated rub at her glasses. Both had their charm, but the rare third option, that nervous scratch at the back of her neck, was always a crowd favorite. A crowd of one, that is.

Then, right on cue, came the second act. Her hand swept into the knot of hair at the back of her head, fingers scratching furiously until, without fail, one of the two pencils in her bun slipped loose and clattered to the floor. I waited every time for her to notice, but she never did. So lost in her creative struggle she was.

And finally, the closing scene. This performance always offered one of two endings. If inspiration struck, she would make a tiny fist, tap it decisively into her open palm, then hurry back to her desk. I would have to order us lunch in that case. If not, she would let out a groan, collapse onto a cushion at the table, and offer to order lunch herself after a couple of minutes.

She stopped pacing and stared at the open doorway. A long, dejected sigh escaped her.

Ah. Or, I suppose, there was the new third ending she had added to the performance recently.

“Lily,” she said, her voice already tired. “I keep telling you to close the door.”

“But the air in here gets so stale,” I answered brightly. “It cannot possibly be good for your skin.”

She didn’t even try to argue. Just a small shake of her head before she crossed the room and reached toward the door.

“Oh! Ringo-sensei!” Risa’s voice carried from the hall. “A little help out here? I can’t get all this in one trip!”

Rin froze, her hand suspended a finger’s breadth from the doorknob.

I was already moving. In one smooth stride, I slipped past her.

“I’ll get it.”

I glanced back with a smile. “Could you hold the door for us?”


When I returned, two bags of paints hung from my arms. Risa followed close behind, balancing a large cardboard box carefully. Together we moved past Rin and into the room.

Risa placed the box gently in the center of the table, and I set my bags down beside it. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught Rin shake her head once. Her hand lingered briefly at her chest, then fell away as she drew in a steadying breath. In the very next step she had slipped back into place, crossing past Risa to claim her usual seat at the head of the table.

“So, Risa,” she began, her voice level once more. “Is this why you haven’t been coming around lately?”

“Mhm,” Risa hummed, nodding. “Had to call in some favors. Princess, any guess what this is?” She gestured between my bags of paint and her mysterious box.

“It looks like acrylics and primer,” I said after a brief glance. “Are we working on another model?”

“Something like that!” Risa chirped. “Need anything else from me?”

“My old brushes should do fine,” I replied. “They were made for oils, but they’ll work. Cleaning them will be troublesome, though.” I would also need a varnish to seal the coat, maybe thinner if the paint proved stubborn, but all that could wait. “I’ll have to see how the paint applies first.”

“Excellent!” Risa beamed, placing her hands on either side of the box. “Because…” She paused for effect, then lifted the box with a flourish, like a magician revealing their final trick. “This is a garage kit!”

My breath caught. On the table where the box had been stood a figure, assembled from what must have been dozens of pieces. All of them were cast in pale white plastic, joined so precisely the seams were nearly invisible.

The color reminded me of the countless plaster statues I had been forced to sketch, but this was different. It *felt* different. Those statues were exercises in precision, with every muscle and fold of fabric carved with painstaking accuracy. This sculpture, however, wasn't concerned with anatomy. Every line was sculpted to convey a personality. To tell a story. In that moment, I understood why Rin filled her shelves with these models.

It was the statue of a little girl, posed with a cheerful confidence. Every line of the sculpture was soft and round, from the impossibly full curls of her hair to the puffed shoulders and the wavy hem of her wide skirt. The design created a wonderful sense of playful volume, as if she were a cloud given human form.

Her smile was wide and completely unguarded, an expression of impossibly pure delight that my tutors would have dismissed as nonsense. In her hand, she held a long staff topped with a flourish shaped like the bristles of a paintbrush. The irony was almost painful; the very instrument of my old life, reimagined here as a source of magic and joy. 

Rin leaned forward, her eyes bright with a rare spark. “Oh! You got an unpainted one?”

“Yup!” Risa said proudly. “It was not easy to get, let me tell you.”

“Should I go get my brushes, then?” I asked, trying to keep my tone even.

“I love the enthusiasm, Princess!” Risa laughed. “But there's no hurry. I'm giving this to you. You can take all the time you need with it.”

I stared at the figure, then back at Risa. “But… aren't these rare?”

“Meh,” she said with a wave of her hand. “I give stuff to Ringo-sensei all the time.” She grinned, tapping the figure’s base. “Besides, this is a model of the one and only Riri-hime! It's only right that the *Princess* herself should have it.”

My own personal Riri-hime. This was a blank canvas. A three-dimensional canvas, free of any rules or expectations. A flicker of something rose in my chest, but I pushed it down immediately. It was just a toy. A project. Nothing more.

Rin, however, was giving Risa a suspicious look. “But all you give me are pre-painted sets, aren’t they?” she pointed out. “You’re scheming something.”

A wicked grin spread across Risa’s face. “Hehe! You catch on quick.”

She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “My evil plan is simple! Once Princess here gets a feel for how these kits are put together…” She paused dramatically. “That’s when we move to the next phase!”

“Which is what?” Rin asked, raising a single eyebrow. 

“We *print* them!” Risa declared.

Print them? Like with a printer? I tried to mimic Rin’s questioning expression, but my eyebrows refused to cooperate. Both of them shot up, or neither moved at all.

“Didn't we try that already?” Rin countered, her eyebrow still raised. “Even the store-bought 3D models ended up looking like crap.”

She glanced over at me, but I was still struggling, trying to solve the complex puzzle of my face.

She let out a soft sigh. “The models always seem to need some kind of tweaking before they'll print properly,” she explained. “But we never figured out how to do it.”

I finally gave up and simply used my index finger to push one of my eyebrows up, holding it in place as I tried to look doubtful.

“Exactly,” Risa jumped in, pointing at Rin. “If we try to print them as is, they'd either collapse or come out looking like melted plastic. We need someone who can actually sculpt.”

Risa’s smile widened, showing her teeth. She threw an arm around Rin’s shoulders, yanking her into a huddle that was still perfectly audible from where I sat. I let my face relax and calmly took a final sip of my now-cool tea.

“Sure, Sensei, we couldn’t do it before,” Risa whispered conspiratorially. “Because neither of us was… *artistically inclined*.”

She glanced over at me, and I gave her a polite little wave.

“Oh!” Rin's eyes widened as the realization dawned. She pulled away from Risa and sat back, her expression thoughtful. A moment passed. Then, her right hand clenched into a small fist and tapped firmly into the open palm of her left. She had an idea.

In a single movement that caught me completely by surprise, she threw an arm around my shoulders, pulling me into a huddle of our own.

Oh! I’m finally part of one!

But sadly, my delight lasted only a fraction of a second. I saw the raw panic flash in Rin's eyes as she registered what she had just done. A lovely pale red began to creep up from the collar of her hoodie. She started to pull her arm back but stopped herself midway. She was probably worried about what I would think if she pulled away too suddenly.

And just like that, she had trapped herself.

Her hand now hovered just over my shoulder, not quite touching, not quite withdrawn, suspended by her own anxieties.

“S-so… ehm…” she stammered. “Y-you know how we haven’t been able to… to s-study? Like, at all?”

Our deal. We had promised to help each other, but the textbooks remained unopened on my desk. My grades were still quite terrible.

I nodded, my cheek now less than an inch from hers.

“W-well,” she continued, her eyes darting everywhere but at me. “We… I m-mean, you… you should ask Risa! To help, in e-exchange for… m-modeling for her.”

She knew she had brought this upon herself, yet she was trying so desperately to play it cool. The fine beads of sweat on her brow gave her away, if her shaking voice wasn't enough of a clue. How cute.

Since her gaze was stubbornly fixed away from me, I leaned in a little closer, my lips almost brushing against the delicate shape of her ear.

“I love it.” I whispered.

A small yelp escaped her. She launched herself backwards, scrambling away until her back hit the far wall of the room, her face a delightful, deep crimson.
