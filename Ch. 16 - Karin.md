Oh… I get it.

I'm going to die today.

Looking back, I wonder if I could say I lived a good life. Probably not. It definitely had its highs and lows, but it was mostly lows. Actually, like ninety percent lows.

Not that it matters now.

The blood drained from my face, and a deep chill rushed in, spreading thin ice from my neck to my palms before melting into cold sweat. 

I wanted to look away. Bolt. Run. Anything. But I couldn't move. My gaze locked on the walking catastrophe responsible for my impending fall. My hands wouldn't stop shaking.

“Well,” she said, her voice impossibly sweet. “Since we can't seem to focus…” 

I swallowed. Then I heard her laugh.

And that laugh… That damned laugh was the sound of every lock in hell clicking open at once. Making way for my condemned soul.

The devil was wearing a deceptively formal suit.

It looked professional at first glance. Almost innocent. But the top buttons were undone, showing a strip of pale skin that my eyes refused to stop tracking.

But that wasn't what was going to kill me.

No.

It was the goddamn mini skirt.

“I thought I should try calling on *Lily-sensei~*” 

The name rolled off her tongue in an alluring tone that vibrated straight through my chest.

_Yuri-sensei…_

She held a brush in one hand, tapping it slowly against her open palm. _Tap. Tap… Tap._

*She could teach me whatever she wanted—*

No, stop. I shook my head, snapping out of the trance just long enough to meet her gaze.

Her eyes were blood red.

… Maybe dying by yuri wasn't the worst way to go.

---

She began to walk. Slowly. Like she knew exactly what she was doing.

My eyes locked on the hem of that stupidly short skirt. With each step, the fabric shifted. Lifted. Just a fraction.

*Thump.* One step.

*Thump.* Another.

*Thump.* One more.

I couldn't look away. Not even if my life depended on it. And at this moment, I was sure that was a fatal mistake.

She stopped.

Right in front of me. Close enough that I had to tilt my head back to see her face. Close enough that there was no mistaking where my eyes had been.

I swallowed. My throat was as dry as sand.

She laughed. Amused.

“Don't worry,” she said, all bright and innocent. Like she was calming a spooked animal. 

Which, fair. I was.

“I'm still wearing my shorts underneath…”

And then—to my absolute, soul-leaving horror—she reached for the hem.

“See?”

My hand shot out and clamped down on her wrist. Pure reflex.

“Stop,” I choked out. “I will actually die.”

She just laughed again. Musical and utterly merciless. “You're no fun,” she pouted, pulling her hand back. She shifted into a thinking pose instead.

“Still…” she said, tilting her head. “I feel like I'm missing something for the full *sensei* look.”

“Yeah,” I croaked. “About two more layers of clothing.”

She gave me a deadpan look. “I'm literally wearing more clothes than I was five minutes ago.”

If that was true, technically, _technically_, she was wearing more clothes.

And yet somehow, through some cursed devil magic, that made it infinitely worse.

My eyes betrayed me, dropping back to that damn skirt like they were magnetized.

Her eyes scanned my face, and then they lit up with a terrifying spark of realization. “Oh! I know. Glasses!”

Her hand started moving toward my face.

And I panicked.

I scrambled backward across the bed, my brain screaming one word on repeat. 

*Run.* 

My hands slipped on the covers. My feet tangled in fabric. I didn't stop until my back hit the wall.

Lily followed. One hand pressed into the mattress. Then the other.

“Just give it up,” she said, bringing one knee onto the bed. She leaned forward with that same patient, devilish smile.

Huh. She actually was wearing shorts. I could see a flash of white fabric just under the—

*KARIN. EYES UP. NOW.*

I jerked my gaze away, but it landed on the straining buttons of her blazer instead.

Oh god. That was worse.

She laughed again. It was soft but deadly. “Honestly,” she said, sitting up. “You're so silly. I'm wearing my gym shirt underneath.”

She brought a hand to the third button.

“Here, I'll show y—”

My hand shot out. Clamped down on hers. Stopped her fingers right as they touched the button. Relief flooded through me for exactly half a second.

Then I realized where my hand was.

Hovering. Directly over her chest. By the smallest margin.

I froze cold, but the heat beside my fingers was unmistakable.

After the longest heartbeat in my pathetically short life, she whispered:

“Gotcha.”

Her free hand darted forward. In one smooth motion, my glasses were gone. 

And the world dissolved into a blur.

_Human Girl Karin pretended not to stare as Pureblood Vampire Lily crossed the marble floor. That golden cascade of hair caught the candlelight like captured dawn. Those crimson eyes held sunset's fire. And that pale skin was like evening clouds. A beauty that held day's colors captive yet commanded night itself._

_Every night, Pureblood Vampire Lily would draw the same ancient volume from the same aging shelf. And every night, Human Girl Karin wondered what it would be like to surrender, to be bound within that endless will, to share that eternity that belonged only to her…_

_But she never asked for it. She never would._

_For vampires must stay fleeting if they are to remain eternal._

_What the human girl did not know was that from behind an unread tome, she was being watched. The vampire had memorized every word here centuries ago. Only one mystery remained in this old library, and that was the mortal who stood unshaken before her. The one mortal who had not once shown her fear. And every night she wondered what it would be like to break that courage, to claim it for herself, to bind it forever to her unending dusk…_

_But she never ordered it. She never would._

Warmth. That was the first thing that registered in my fried brain. Something soft and warm against the top of my head.

Wait. Warm?

My eyes cracked open. I tried to sit up—because lying here was definitely not helping the situation—but gentle pressure on my forehead stopped me and pushed me back down.

W-Where—?

Then familiar weight settled on my nose. The blurred ceiling sharpened as my glasses slid into place. Right. Lily's room.

“You're awake,” she said.

It took me another moment to recall everything that just happened. The whole hot teacher incident. 

I adjusted the frames, trying to salvage whatever dignity I had left. “G-Gave up on the teacher look already?”

“Just the glasses.” Her voice had gone sheepish. “I got dizzy.”

Indeed, she was still wearing that ridiculous teacher costume, but whatever terrifying energy she'd been radiating before had completely vanished. Now she just looked… kind of awkward, honestly.

I could work with awkward. Awkward was manageable.

She shifted slightly, looking down at me. “So, Student Karin,” she said, that playful lilt sneaking back into her voice. “How are you doing in your other classes?”

I thought about her question for a while. 

The truth? This university doesn't actually care if you show up. Everything goes through the online portal. Only reason I'm still enrolled and not completely screwed. 

But it's not like it's easy. I'm basically teaching myself from whatever scraps the professors post online and hoping I can piece together what the hell is going on. Though, to be fair, Lily's been bringing me notes. When she actually goes to class. Which… hasn't been as often lately. 

“Not too bad,” I mumbled.

Her playful expression softened into something else. Concern, maybe? “Are you having any issues with… not being able to leave your room?” 

_Oh._

That was it. The whole absurd costume. The teacher role-play. All of it was just her roundabout way of asking this one question without making me feel cornered.

She was worried. 

About me.

Doing all this just for someone like me was stupid. Completely, utterly stupid. 

And somehow… that was very Lily.

For once, she didn't feel untouchable. She just felt like… a girl. A weird, awkward girl who didn't know how to ask if I was okay without stepping on a landmine.

I put an arm over my face to hide the blush that was starting to form.

“I'm doing fine,” I said, and it was mostly true. “This university doesn't really care about attendance. I don't know what I'll do about finals, though.”

“Mhmm. I see…” she hummed.

I sat up. “What about you? You've been skipping a lot lately.”

A small, proud smile touched her lips. “I do, don't I?” Not a hint of shame in her voice. 

I almost laughed. Here she was, acting like cutting class was some kind of achievement. It was kind of funny, seeing this perfect princess type so damn pleased with herself for being a delinquent.

“Lily-sensei demands a report,” she said, tapping the laptop screen. “English. Your grade?”

“I should be good for at least a B+,” I said, straightening up.

“That's really good!” She looked genuinely impressed, then her face fell. “That makes sense. You like writing.” A heavy sigh. “I'm hoping for a C-.”

I blinked. Wait, seriously?

I was actually… better at something than her? I'd just assumed she'd be crushing every class while I scraped by.

Huh.

“What about Calculus?” she asked, perking up immediately. Her eyes actually lit up. “That's one of my best classes. Almost an A.”

I stared at her. “Wait, really? Damn. I'm barely passing that one.”

Math. She was actually good at math. I'd written her off as purely artsy. All painting, no numbers. Turns out I was dead wrong.

A smug little grin spread across her face. “I'll be happy to teach you one day.”

My brain helpfully supplied an extremely detailed image of her leaning over my shoulder, explaining derivatives while wearing that stupidly short skirt—

Nope. Not going there.

“Yeah, yeah,” I muttered, pushing the thought away. “We'll see.”

I hesitated, then forced myself to ask something that had been gnawing at me for weeks. “What about… Chemistry?”

My voice came out smaller than I meant it to. “I haven't been able to submit any of the lab work. I don't know if I can even pass without—”

“Oh, don't worry about it,” she cut in, waving a hand dismissively. “I already put you down as part of my lab group. You're covered.”

I froze. “You… what?”

“For the group assignments,” she said, like it was the most normal thing in the world. “I just wrote your name down. It's fine.”

My throat felt tight. 

“Though don't expect a C in that class,” she added with a grimace. “I'm not exactly doing great myself.”

She said it so casually. Like everything she was doing for someone like me was just normal. Not worth mentioning.

But it wasn't nothing. Not to me.

“Th-Thank you,” I managed. My voice sounded small. “For… you know. The notes. And the… lab thing. All of it.”

She looked at me then, and her face lit up with that bright smile that made my chest feel warm.

“It's nothing,” she said.

But it wasn't. It really wasn't.

“Programming, though…” She shuddered.

I looked at the laptop screen and remembered Risa's program. “The absolute worst,” I agreed.

“Pure suffering,” she nodded.

We looked at each other for a second, then a laugh escaped her lips, and one bubbled up out of mine. Strange, hearing my own laughter mixing with hers in the quiet room.

It wasn't the sound of some weirdo laughing with a goddess. It was just… two girls. Lost. Figuring things out together.

Maybe I could get used to this.

---

The rest of the afternoon passed in a nice silence.

I'd vetoed Lily's initial suggestion of ordering cake for dinner—again—and convinced her to get actual food. We settled on Chinese takeout. Well, I settled on it. She pouted for three solid minutes until I promised we'd get dessert after.

The food arrived in white takeout boxes. Fried rice. Not super healthy, but better than pure sugar. Lily battled her chopsticks for five minutes before I slid her a spare fork. She took it with a sheepish smile.

We worked through assignments after eating, Risa's program doing most of the actual coding while we pretended to supervise. Lily's notes were surprisingly helpful, despite her not knowing most of what she was writing down. 

When the sky outside started to darken, I finally gathered my things. My back protested as I stretched, muscles stiff from hours on Lily's bed.

“Are you sure you don't want me to walk with you?” Lily asked from the bed, concern clear in her voice.

My chest tightened. 

Fair. A week ago, I couldn't even make it to the door without freezing.

“I'll be fine,” I said. For the first time in a long time, it didn't feel like a complete lie.

Her brow furrowed. Unconvinced.

“I need to get used to it,” I added. Honest.

“Message me as soon as you get there, okay?” she insisted, sitting up.

The concern in her voice felt warm. She actually cared.

“I will,” I said, and despite the nervous flutter in my stomach, my smile widened. “Promise.”

I walked to her door, feeling a strange sense of accomplishment. It had been a good day. A really good day. I reached for the doorknob, ready to head back to my own room.

My hand froze mid-air.

There, hanging from the outside of the door—visible to anyone walking down the hallway—was a single, pure white sock.

My brain stalled.

A sock. On the door. The universal dorm signal for “do not disturb, occupants are… occupied.”

Oh no.

Oh *no*.

We'd been in here for hours. With the sock on the door. The *entire time*.

My head turned with the slow, mechanical precision of rusted hinges. I looked back at Lily.

She was sitting on her bed, hands folded in her lap, beaming at me with the most angelic, infuriatingly innocent smile I had ever seen in my life.

“Lily,” I said slowly, my voice barely above a whisper. “Why the hell is there a sock on your door?”

“Oh!” Her eyes lit up. “Risa said it's polite to put it up when you have visitors. I didn't want to forget.”

She said it with such genuine earnestness that I couldn't tell if she was completely clueless or the most devious person I'd ever met.

My face was on fire. “That's… that's not exactly what that means…”

“It's not?” She tilted her head. Pure, innocent confusion.

I was going to die. Right here. In Lily's doorway. Death by mortification.

A cold dread washed over me—far worse than any demon in a miniskirt. My hand fumbled for my phone. I hadn't checked it all day.

The screen lit up.

Twenty missed calls.

All from Risa.

_Oh no._

I looked at Lily one more time. Still smiling. Completely, blissfully unaware of the social disaster she'd created.

Risa was never, *ever* going to let me live this down.
