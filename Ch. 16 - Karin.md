Oh… I get it.

I'm going to die today.

Looking back, I wonder if I could say I lived a good life. Probably not. It definitely had its highs and lows, but it was mostly lows. Actually, like ninety percent lows.

Not that it matters now.

The blood drained from my face and a deep chill rushed in, spreading thin ice from my neck to my palms before melting into cold sweat. 

I wanted to look away, to bolt, but I couldn't. My gaze froze on the walking catastrophe responsible for my impending demise. My hands wouldn't stop shaking.

"Well," she said, her voice impossibly sweet. "Since we can't seem to focus..." 

Then she laughed.

And that laugh... That damned laugh was the sound of every lock in hell simultaneously clicking open. Making way for my condemned soul.

The devil was wearing a deceptively formal suit.

It professional enough at first glance. Almost innocent. But the top buttons were undone, revealing a deliberate strip of pale skin that my traitorous eyes refused to stop tracking.

But that wasn't what was going to kill me.

No.

That was the goddamn mini skirt.

"I thought I should try calling on *Lily-sensei~*" 

That name rolled off her tongue in an alluring purr that seemed to vibrate through my chest.

_Yuri-sensei…_

*Maybe she’d been the real teacher all along.*

She held a brush in one hand, tapping it slowly against her open palm. _Tap. Tap… Tap._

*And she could teach me whatever she wanted—*

No, stop. I shook my head, snapping out of the trance just long enough to meet her gaze.

They were blood red.

But maybe dying by yuri wasn’t the worst way to go.  {consider removing this line or joining it with the teach me line}

---

She began to walk. Slowly. Like she knew exactly what she was doing.

My eyes locked on the hem of that stupidly short skirt. With each step, the fabric shifted. Lifted. Just a fraction.

*Thump.* One Step.

*Thump.* Another.

*Thump.* One more.

I couldn't have looked away if my life depended on it.

Then she stopped.

She stood in front of me. Close enough that I had to tilt my head back just to see her face. Close enough that there was no mistaking where my eyes had been locked.

I swallowed hard. My throat was dry as sand.

An amused laugh left her lips.

"Don't worry," she said brightly, like she was trying to calm a spooked animal. Which, to be fair, she absolutely was.

"I'm still wearing my shorts underneath..."

And then, to my absolute, soul-leaving horror, she reached for the hem.

"See?"

My hand shot out and clamped down on her wrist before she could lift the fabric. Pure survival instinct.

"Stop," I choked out. "I will actually die."

She just laughed again. Musical and utterly merciless. "You're no fun," she pouted, pulling her hand back. She shifted into a thinking pose instead.

"Still..." she said, tilting her head. "I feel like I'm missing something for the full *sensei* look."

"Yeah," I croaked. "About two more layers of clothing."

She gave me a deadpan look. "I'm literally wearing more clothes than I was five minutes ago."

She was right. Technically. She was absolutely wearing more clothes.

But somehow, through some cursed devil magic, that made it infinitely worse. 

Her eyes scanned my face, and then they lit up with a terrifying spark of realization. "Oh! I know. Glasses!"

Her hand started moving towards my face.

And I panicked.

I scrambled backward across the bed, my brain screaming one word on repeat. *Run. Run. Run.* My hands slipped on the covers. My feet tangled in fabric. I didn't stop until my back slammed against the wall.

Lily followed. One hand pressed into the mattress. Then the other.

"Just give it up," she said, bringing one knee onto the bed. She leaned forward with that same patient, devilish smile.

Huh. She actually was wearing shorts. I could see a flash of white fabric just under her—

*KARIN. EYES UP. NOW*

I jerked my eyes away, but what they found where the straining buttons of her jacket...

Oh god. That was worse.

She laughed again, a soft sound that did terrible things to my heart rate. "Honestly," she said, sitting up. "You are so silly. I'm wearing my gym shirt underneath."

She brought a hand to the third button of her suit.

"Here, I'll show y—"

My hand flew out again, this time clamping down on hers, stopping her fingers just as they began to pull. Relief flooded through me for exactly half a second.

And then I realized where my hand was.

It was hovering, by the smallest margin, directly over her chest.

I froze.

After the longest heartbeat in my pathetically short life, she whispered.

"Gotcha."

Her free hand darted forward. In one smooth motion, my glasses were gone. 

And the world dissolved into a blur.

**Summary:** A pair of idiots meet on a castle library.

_Human Girl Karin pretended not to stare as Pureblood Vampire Lily crossed the marble floor. That golden cascade of hair caught the candlelight like captured dawn. Those crimson eyes held sunset's fire. And that pale skin was like evening clouds. A beauty that held day's colors captive yet commanded night itself._
>
_Every night Pureblood Vampire Lily would draw forth the same ancient volume from the same shelf. And every night, Human Girl Karin wondered what it would be like to surrender, to be bound within that endless will, to share that eternity which belonged only to her..._
>
_But she never asked for it. She never would._
>
_For vampires must stay fleeting if they are to remain eternal._
>
_What the human girl did not know was that from behind an unread tome, she was being watched. The vampire had memorized every word here centuries ago. Only one mystery remained in this old library, and that was the mortal who stood unshaken before her. The one mortal who had not once shown her fear. And every night she wondered what it would be like to break that courage, to claim it for herself, to bind it forever to her unending dusk..._

_But she never ordered it. She never would._

_Inside, a single candle trembled in the charged silence, flickering with the unspoken words._
_Outside, the moon climbed higher, red as spilled wine and twice as intoxicating._
