Oh… I get it.

I'm going to die today.

Looking back, I wonder if I could say I lived a good life. Probably not. It definitely had its highs and lows, but it was mostly lows. Actually, like ninety percent lows.

Not that it matters now.

The blood drained from my face and a deep chill rushed in, spreading thin ice from my neck to my palms before melting into cold sweat. 

I wanted to look away, to bolt, but I couldn't. My gaze froze on the walking catastrophe responsible for my impending demise. My hands wouldn't stop shaking.

"Well," she said, her voice impossibly sweet. "Since we can't seem to focus..." 

Then she laughed.

And that laugh... That damned laugh was the sound of every lock in hell simultaneously clicking open. Making way for my condemned soul.

The devil was wearing a deceptively formal suit.

It professional enough at first glance. Almost innocent. But the top buttons were undone, revealing a deliberate strip of pale skin that my traitorous eyes refused to stop tracking.

But that wasn't what was going to kill me.

No.

That was the goddamn mini skirt.

"I thought I should try calling on *Lily-sensei~*" 

That name rolled off her tongue in an alluring purr that seemed to vibrate through my chest.

_Yuri-sensei…_

*Maybe she’d been the real teacher all along.*

She held a brush in one hand, tapping it slowly against her open palm. _Tap. Tap… Tap._

*And she could teach me whatever she wanted—*

No, stop. I shook my head, snapping out of the trance just long enough to meet her gaze.

They were blood red.

But maybe dying by yuri wasn’t the worst way to go.  {consider removing this line or joining it with the teach me line}

---

She began to walk. Slowly. Like she knew exactly what she was doing.

My eyes locked on the hem of that stupidly short skirt. With each step, the fabric shifted. Lifted. Just a fraction.

*Thump.* One Step.

*Thump.* Another.

*Thump.* One more.

I couldn't have looked away if my life depended on it.

Then she stopped.

She stood in front of me. Close enough that I had to tilt my head back just to see her face. Close enough that there was no mistaking where my eyes had been locked.

I swallowed hard. My throat was dry as sand.

An amused laugh left her lips.

"Don't worry," she said brightly, like she was trying to calm a spooked animal—which, to be fair, she absolutely was.

"I'm still wearing my shorts underneath..."

And then, to my absolute, soul-leaving horror, she reached for the hem.

"See?"

My hand shot out in a lightning-fast blur born of pure survival instinct, and clamped down on her wrist before she could lift the fabric.

"Stop," I choked out. "I will actually die."

She just laughed again. Musical and utterly merciless. "You're no fun," she pouted, but she released her hand. Assuming a thinking posture instead. 

"Still..." she said, tilting her head, "I feel I'm still missing something for the full *sensei* look."

"Yeah," I croaked, "about two more layers of clothing."

She gave me a deadpan look. "I'm literally wearing more clothes than I was five minutes ago."

I was subconsciously aware she was actually wearing *more* clothes. But whatever black magic this devil had used had somehow managed to make it worse. 

Her eyes scanned my face, and then they lit up with a terrifying spark of realization. "Oh! I know. Glasses!"

Her hand started moving towards my face.

And I panicked.

I scrambled backward on the bed, my brain screaming at me to retreat. NOW. My hands and feet messing the covers until my back slammed into the wall.

Lily followed. She placed one hand on the bed, then the other.

"Just give it up," she said as she brought one knee up onto the mattress, leaning forward with that same patient smile.

*Huh. She was actually wearing shorts. I could see a white strip of cloth peeking under her skirt.*

I slapped myself. 

*Stop.* 

I tried to press myself further into the wall, but there was nowhere left to run. Lily was fully on the bed now, crawling towards me, and my gaze was fixed in sheer terror on the straining buttons of her suit.

She laughed again, a soft sound that did terrible things to my heart rate. "Honestly," she said, sitting up. "You are so silly. I'm wearing my gym shirt underneath."

She brought a hand to the third button of her suit.

"Here, I'll show y—"

My hand flew out again, this time clamping down on hers, stopping her fingers just as they began to pull at the button. I had stopped her. I left relief wash over me for a split second. 

And then I realized where my hand was.

It was hovering, by the smallest margin, directly over her chest.

I froze.

After the longest heartbeat in my short life, she whispered.

"Gotcha."

Her free hand darted forward, and in a flash of movement, my glasses were gone.

And the world literally dissolved into a blur.
