I nudged the door open with my shoulder, one arm securing two paper bags against my chest. As expected, Rin was at her desk and the usual click-clack of her keyboard was the only sound filling the room.

I walked over to the table and set the bags down with a soft rustle.

“Is that you, Lily?” she asked without turning.

So, she assumes it’s me now, not Risa. A pleasant warmth spread through my chest. How nice.

 “You’re here early toda—” Rin continued, but her voice cut off when she finally turned. 

She was frozen mid-turn. Her mouth was slightly agape, her eyes wide behind her glasses. But her gaze wasn’t on my face, though. It was fixed, unblinking, right on my stomach.

It’s this top, isn’t it? After all those days of eating nothing but instant noodles and cake, perhaps wearing something so… revealing was a poor choice. I've definitely gained some weight. How terribly embarrassing.

“Well, since we’ve been eating so unhealthily lately,” I said, forcing a bright, cheerful tone into my voice, “I figured we should exercise a bit!”

Rin didn’t respond. Her mouth opened a fraction wider as her gaze slowly drifted down to my shorts. She seemed so concerned. It must be the length; perhaps she finds them too bold. I should put her mind at ease.

Waving a dismissive hand, I added, “Oh, don’t worry, yours doesn’t have shorts. I didn’t think you’d be comfortable in them.”

Her eyes finally snapped up to meet mine. They were wide with what looked like pure panic.

“Wh-what do you mean… *mine*?” she asked, her voice a strangled whisper. I could see a faint sheen of sweat on her brow.

Poor thing. She really must hate the idea of working out.

“I got us matching sets!” I explained. “So we can work out together in the mornings.”

I reached into one of the bags and pulled out a sleek, black athletic shirt with long sleeves.

“I had to guess your size from memory,” I said, holding it up. “But I’m pretty confident this will fit.”

“W-when did I agree to any of this?” she stammered, shaking her head.

She was just being shy.

“Come on,” I said, closing the space between us with an encouraging smile. My fingers found the hem of her oversized hoodie. “Just a few warm-up stretches. It’ll be good for us.”

She yelped and her hands flew down to clutch the fabric, holding it down for dear life.

I tilted my head, my smile unwavering. “Don’t tell me you aren’t wearing anything underneath that?”

“W-what?! Of course I am!”

“Then there’s no problem!” I insisted, giving the hoodie another encouraging tug. “We barely move all day. This will help.”

Her face was a mess of color, her eyes squeezed shut.

"Fine! Fine!" she finally relented. "Just… let go! I'll change, just let me do it by myself."

I released her hoodie and offered her the white paper bag. She snatched it from my hand without a word before disappearing into the bathroom.

The door clicked shut, and for the first time since I'd met her, the room was silent. For a moment, it felt like that very first day I'd visited her room—this library of secrets spread before me, waiting to be explored. 

I let my fingers trail along the spines of the nearest shelf, past titles that promised adventure and romance in equal measure. My eyes wandered upward to the higher shelves, and quickly found the model I'd painted last week, still posed in the same defiant stance I'd left it in. I could already see it flaking at the joints, I really should use a proper primer next time.

A few inches away sat another familiar sight: the unpainted Riri-hime figure with her puffy sleeves and impossibly cheerful curls. A soft chuckle escaped me. Risa insisted on calling me 'Princess' because of this little thing, but looking at that wide, unguarded smile, I couldn't see the resemblance at all.

As I turned from the shelf, the soft glow from the corner of the room finally caught my attention.

Her desk. Her monitor.

Her stories… the one part of this colorful world that was truly, entirely hers. Surely, a little peek couldn't hurt.

I wonder what she’s writing right now?

My eyes moved on their own. I leaned over her chair, careful not to disturb anything, and peeked at the monitor. The screen was filled with a dense block of text, but the incomplete line near the cursor made my breath catch.

_Her eyes fluttered shut as my lips finally met hers, soft, warm and—_

I pulled back from the screen as if it were as hot as my cheeks felt. Soft, warm, and… and _what_?

The sharp _click_ of the doorknob turning sent a jolt of pure panic through me. My heart leaped into my throat. I stumbled backward, catching myself just in time to glide to the center of the room, hoping the blush on my face wasn't as obvious as it felt.

Rin stepped out of the bathroom, and my mind went completely blank. She looked...

### **Study in Contradiction**
>
>_Marble, circa autumn 2025._
> 
>The piece is carved from a single block of white marble, presenting the likeness of a young woman in modern athletic attire. Within the cold permanence of stone, the artist captures a moment of internal conflict, setting clothing against character in quiet tension.
> 
>The figure’s head tilts gently forward, hair bound in a deliberate coil that emphasizes the weight of her downward gaze. The eyes, carved with softened detail behind a pair of round glasses, avoid the viewer's gaze, conveying a profound shyness.
>
>Her arms fold across the body in a gesture that both shields and discloses. The embrace is incomplete, a hesitant defense that paradoxically draws the viewer closer, exposing the tenderness it seeks to conceal.
>
>Her legs are sculpted in a narrow stance, their weight distributed so finely that the entire figure appears balanced on the edge of collapse. This delicate equilibrium is a testament to the sculptor’s technical mastery, capturing fragility without sacrificing stability.
>
>The piece is a contradiction made marble: the desire to vanish versus the certainty of being seen. What emerges is the unforgiving honesty of her presentation, both fragile and unyielding.
>
>But most of all, absolutely entrancing.
>

My trance was broken by the faintest of movements. Her face was still a delicate shade of pink when she opened her mouth and began to speak. my gaze followed the movement of her lips as she formed the quiet words.

_They were soft, warm, and—_

My mind screeched to a halt. I cut the thought off before it could possibly complete itself. No. I was losing my composure. 

I forced a reassuring smile onto my face. “You know,” I said, my voice softer than I intended. “I was right. That fits you perfectly.”

She didn’t seem convinced.

“Alright, let’s find some space,” I said, looking around the room.

We pushed aside the one cushion that never seemed to get used, clearing a small rectangle of floor between the low table and the kitchenette. There wasn’t much room to work with. Maybe next time I could convince her to come to my room instead. If there is one thing that place has in abundance, it’s empty space.

“Okay, you first,” I instructed. “Sit down and spread your legs. Try to reach for your toes.”

Rin sat, her movements as stiff as a new paintbrush. I knelt behind her and placed my hands on the small of her back, and she immediately flinched, her entire body going rigid. Even through the thin fabric of her shirt, I could feel the heat of her skin and the frantic rhythm of her breathing.

"Just breathe," I whispered, letting my fingertips trace the rigid frame of her back. It was a bit like sculpting in reverse—trying to soften hardened clay rather than shape it. I let my palms glide up the outer edges of her back, feeling the fine tremor that ran through her in response. Then again, I traced those same paths, this time drawing out a little more tension. "Let go," I murmured, pressing my thumbs gently into the knots beside her spine, and felt the exact moment she surrendered with a long, shaky sigh as her entire body went pliant beneath my touch. A small victory.

She remained there her forehead resting on the floor. I watched the slow rise and fall of her back for a moment before I finally broke the quiet. "Alright, my turn."

"Fine... whatever." She said after a defeated grumble.

I shifted, taking her place on the floor and waiting as she slowly moved into position behind me. The silence stretched, and I could feel her hesitation behind me. When her hands finally made contact with my back, her fingers trembled so much it tickled.

A surprised laugh escaped me before I could stop it. Her hands vanished instantly.

“It’s okay,” I said, looking over my shoulder with a reassuring smile. I didn't mean to startle her. “You can touch me a little harder, please. I won’t break.”

She let out a resigned sigh, then said, “please, don’t start…”

Her hands returned a moment later, still hesitant, but with a new resolve. I leaned into her warm, uncertain touch, letting her guide the stretch.

“Alright, next,” I said, once we were done. “Sit-ups. You can hold my feet.”

I lay back, the floor cool against my skin. She knelt at my feet, her hands settling over my ankles. Her grip was surprisingly strong. I took a deep breath, tightened my core, and pulled. Nothing. I tried again, managing to lift my shoulders a few inches before collapsing back down with a groan. We really weren’t very athletic, were we?

“Come on…” I muttered, more determined now.

I gritted my teeth, closed my eyes, and poured every last bit of strength into one final push. My body lurched upward, momentum carrying me much further and faster than I’d expected.

When I opened my eyes, the world had shrunk to the space of a single breath.

Her face was right there. An inch away.

Time slowed. Her dark eyes were wide, fixed on mine. The only sound in the universe was the soft, uneven hitch of our breathing. My gaze drifted down from her stunned eyes to her mouth. Her lips were slightly parted.

_Soft, warm, and—_

_BZZZZZZT. BZZZZZZT._

A single, sharp buzz from her desk shattered the moment like glass. We both jumped. Rin let out a small yelp and let go of my feet.

My body, with no anchor, fell backward, landing on the floor with a soft _thump_. A second later, with a weary gasp of her own, she flopped backward too.

And so we lay there. Not side-by-side, but in an awkward line, both staring up at the plain white ceiling. From this angle, I couldn't see her face, and I knew she couldn't see mine. An unspoken, mutual truce.

For an entire minute, we didn't speak and we didn't move.

_BZZZZZT._

The phone buzzed again, insistent in the quiet room.

"Aren't you going to get that?" I asked Rin.

Her voice came muffled from the floor. "It has to be Risa."

"Right." I rolled onto my side and pushed myself up. She hadn't moved an inch. "So… are we going?"

She took long, deep breath that seemed to pull all the air in the room. Her voice, when it came, was brittle. “I’ll be fine. I’ve been there plenty of times.”

It sounded like a line she had rehearsed. A soldier preparing for a battle no one else could see.

"Alright, then," I said, getting to my feet with bright energy. I retrieved the paper bags and pulled out a pair of baggy white pants and a matching jacket.

From the floor, Rin watched as I pulled the pants on over my shorts and zipped the jacket to my chin. 

"You… you had normal clothes in there this whole time?" She asked, her voice mixed irritation with disbelief. 

I smoothed the front of my jacket. "Well, I couldn't go out wearing just that."

Another sigh escaped her. "But in here it was fine?"

"Of course," I said, tilting my head with a soft smile. "How else are we going to do our daily stretches?"

Her eyes went wide with fresh horror. "Did you just say… _daily_?"

In response to her horror, I just offered a soft smile. Stepping closer, I extended my hand.

"Shall we go?"

But she pointedly ignored it, using the table to push herself to her feet instead. She brushed off her pants, refusing to meet my eyes.

How stubborn. Is this what she called *tsundere* before? I can see why people find it charming.

I let my hand fall back to my side. My gaze drifted to the laptop backpack I'd left by the door, and something occurred to me. But not yet. For now, I simply waited.

After a moment that stretched thin, Rin took a shallow breath. She turned and began walking toward the door. Her steps were careful, measured, and slow, like someone crossing thin ice. When she reached the door, her hand rose and paused before gripping the doorknob. Her knuckles went white. With a slow turn, the door swung open to reveal the empty, bright hallway.

I watched her shoulders drop when she saw no one was there. Her breathing evened out. She seemed fine now.

I walked up to join her at the threshold, picking up my backpack and holding it by just one strap.

"Rin, could you help me with this?"

She gave me a flat look. "You carried three bags in here without breaking a sweat."

"Well, maybe that's why my arms are so tired now."

She looked skeptical.

"How about we compromise?" I said brightly. "We can carry it together."

I held out one of the straps to her. She let out a long sigh, but she took it.

We stepped out into the hallway, leaving the door open behind us. I held one strap of my backpack while she gripped the other, like we were walking a small kid between us.

Risa's room waited at the very end of the hall, past just one other door. Not far at all. Maybe fifteen steps.

I walked slightly behind her, letting her set the pace. Her shoulders hunched forward and her head stayed down. Her eyes where fixed on that distant door like it was the only safe place in the world. One careful step. Then another.

She gripped the strap so tightly her knuckles had gone white. I could feel the tension through the fabric, the way her hand trembled just slightly with each step. Her breathing had grown slightly shallow.

We passed the door to the room beside hers. Almost there now.

But then she stopped. Just froze mid-step.The hallway's silence pressed in around us. For her, it must feel too wide and empty.

"Rin?" I asked softly, trying to make my voice as gentle as possible. "Are you alright?"
