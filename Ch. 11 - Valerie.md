I pushed the door open with my shoulder, balancing two paper bags against my chest. Morning light streamed through the window, but Rin sat hunched in her own small pool of blue-white glow. Even this early, she was already there. Or perhaps still there. Something about finding her exactly where I expected, even at this odd hour, made me smile.

I walked over to the table and set the bags down with a soft rustle.

“Is that you, Lily?” she asked without turning.

Not Risa but me, huh? Something about that made me unreasonably happy.

“You're here early toda—” Rin continued, but her voice cut off when she finally turned.

She had frozen mid-turn. Her mouth hung slightly open, eyes wide behind her glasses, fixed somewhere decidedly below my face.

The athletic top I was wearing was more fitted than I'd expected. Weeks of our poor diet had definitely left their mark. Did she notice? I felt heat creep into my cheeks. Whether from embarrassment or something else entirely, I couldn't quite say.

“Well, since we’ve been eating so unhealthily lately,” I said, forcing brightness into my voice, “I figured we should start exercising together.”

Her eyes stayed fixed exactly where they were, but the shade of red blooming across her face deepened a notch, spreading from her cheeks down to her neck. 

Wonderful.

When she finally moved, her mouth opened slightly wider, and I watched her gaze drift lower, past my waist, traveling slowly down to the shorts. The athletic fabric ended mid-thigh, and judging by the way her eyes had gone completely still, she had noticed.

“Oh, don't worry,” I said with a dismissive wave of my hand, “yours doesn't have shorts. I didn't think you'd be comfortable in them.”

Her eyes finally snapped up to meet mine. Wide. Almost glassy behind her glasses. The panic in them was so clear I could have painted it.

“Wh-what do you mean… *mine*?” The words barely made it past her lips. A fine sheen of sweat had appeared along her hairline.

She looked so distressed. I probably should have mentioned this plan earlier.

“I got us matching sets,” I said as I pulled out a sleek, black athletic shirt with long sleeves from one of the bags. “So we can exercise together.” I held it up between us. “I had to guess your size from memory, but I'm fairly confident this will fit.”

“W-when did I agree to any of this?” she stammered, her head shaking in small, rapid movements.

I studied her face. The deep flush. The slight tremor in her hands. The way she retreated into her chair was some kind of trap.

“You'll look good in it,” I said softly, stepping closer with what I hoped was an encouraging smile. My fingers found the hem of her oversized hoodie. “Just a few warm-up stretches to start. It'll be good for both of us.”

Then I pulled. 

She let out a cute cry as her hands shot down to trap the hoodie against her body.

I paused, tilting my head slightly. “Don't tell me you're not wearing anything underneath?”

“W-what?! Like hell I'm not!”

“Well then, there's no problem.” I kept my tone light and gave the fabric another gentle tug upward. “We barely move all day, Rin. This will really help.”

The color in her face had reached a deep scarlet. Her eyes were squeezed shut, and I could see her jaw clenched tight.

“Fine! Fine!” The words burst out of her. “Just—just let go! I'll change, okay? Just let me do it myself!”

I released the fabric immediately and held out the white paper bag. She practically ripped it from my hands before fleeing toward the bathroom.

The door shut with more force than necessary.

I looked down at my hands, still warm from where they'd held her hoodie.

That went well, I think.

The door clicked shut, and the room fell into a silence I'd never experienced here before. It felt almost like that very first day. This library of secrets spread before me, waiting to be explored.

I let my fingers trail along the nearest shelf, brushing past colorful spines that promised adventure and romance in equal measure. My gaze drifted upward to the higher shelves, where the model I'd painted last week still held its defiant stance. The paint had already begun flaking at the joints. I really should use a proper primer next time.

A few inches away sat the unpainted Riri-hime figure, all puffy sleeves and impossibly cheerful curls. A soft laugh escaped me. Risa kept insisting on calling me “Princess” because of this little thing, but looking at that wide, unguarded smile, I couldn't see any resemblance.

As I turned from the shelf, my eyes caught on the soft glow coming from the corner of the room.

My feet carried me toward it before I'd made any conscious decision to move.

Her desk. Her monitor. Her stories… the one part of this colorful world that was truly, entirely hers.

A little peek wouldn't hurt, would it? Just to see what she was working on.

I leaned over the abandoned chair, careful not to disturb the precarious stack of papers balanced on the corner. The screen was filled with text, line after line of dialogues and descriptions. My eyes scanned down to where the writing stopped, to the incomplete sentence blinking at the cursor.

_Her eyes fluttered shut as my lips finally met hers, soft, warm, and—_

I jerked back from the screen like I'd been burned. Heat flooded my face immediately. 

Soft, warm, and… and what? Seriously, what else could they be?

The doorknob clicked.

A spike of pure panic seized my chest. I jerked backward from the desk, my hip catching the edge painfully. My hands flew up as if that would somehow erase what I'd just been doing. Two stumbling steps carried me toward the center of the room, where I froze like a guilty child caught with her hand in the cookie jar.

The door opened.

Rin stepped out.

And my mind simply… stopped.

### **Study in Contradiction**
>
>_Marble, circa autumn 2025._
> 
>The piece is carved from a single block of white marble, presenting the likeness of a young woman in contemporary athletic attire. Within the cold permanence of stone, the artist captures a moment of internal conflict, setting clothing against character in quiet tension.
> 
>The figure’s head tilts gently forward, hair bound in a deliberate coil that emphasizes the weight of her downward gaze. The eyes, carved with softened detail behind a pair of round glasses, avoid the viewer's gaze, conveying a profound shyness.
>
>Her arms fold across the body in a gesture that both shields and discloses. The embrace is incomplete, a hesitant defense that paradoxically draws the viewer closer, exposing the tenderness it seeks to conceal.
>
>Her legs are sculpted in a narrow stance, their weight distributed so finely that the entire figure appears balanced on the edge of collapse. This delicate equilibrium is a testament to the sculptor’s technical mastery, capturing fragility without sacrificing stability.
>
>The piece is a contradiction made marble: the desire to vanish versus the certainty of being seen. What emerges is the unforgiving honesty of her presentation, both fragile and unyielding.
>
>But most of all, absolutely entrancing.
>

Her face was still painted in many delicate shades of pink when she finally managed to speak.

“So…” Her voice came out small. “W-what do you think?”

But I wasn't listening to the words. My gaze had fixed on the movement of her lips, and suddenly all I could see was that incomplete sentence still burned into my mind.

_Soft, warm, and—_

I blinked, heat flooding my face. Then discreetly pinched the side of my thigh. 

“You know,” I said quickly, “I was right. That fits you perfectly.”

She didn’t seem convinced.

Right. I needed to focus. To stop thinking about—

“Alright, let's find some space,” I announced, scanning the room with sudden determination.

We pushed aside the unused cushion, clearing a small rectangle of floor between the table and kitchenette. It wasn't much space. Maybe next time I could convince her to use my room instead. If there was anything that room had, it was empty space.

“Okay, you first,” I instructed. “Sit down and try to reach for your toes.”

Rin sat with all the grace of a wooden plank. I knelt behind her and placed my hands on her back. She flinched immediately, going rigid.

“Just breathe,” I whispered. Through the fabric I could feel the heat of her skin, the frantic pace of her breathing.

My hands traced up her spine, thumbs pressing gently into the knots along her shoulders. It was like trying to soften hardened clay.

She released a long, shaky breath and finally melted beneath my touch.

I watched the slow rise and fall of her back, her forehead still resting on the floor.

“Alright,” I said softly. “My turn.”

“Fine… whatever.”

I took her place on the floor, settling in as she slowly repositioned herself behind me. The room went quiet except for the sound of her trying to figure out where to put her hands.

When she finally touched my back, her fingers were trembling so badly it tickled.

A surprised laugh escaped me.

Her hands disappeared immediately.

“It's okay,” I said, looking back at her. “You can push harder. I won't break, I promise.”

She groaned. “Please don't start…”

Her hands returned, trembling less this time. I leaned into her touch and let her guide me forward.

“Alright, next,” I said, once we were done. “Sit-ups. You can hold my feet.”

I lay back on the cool floor. She knelt at my feet, her hands settling over my ankles with a surprisingly firm grip. I took a breath, tightened my core, and pulled myself up. Nothing happened. I tried again, barely lifting my shoulders before collapsing back with a groan. We really weren't athletic at all, were we? 

“Come on…” I muttered.

I gritted my teeth, squeezed my eyes shut, and threw everything I had into one final attempt. My body lurched upward, momentum carrying me much further than I'd planned.

When I opened my eyes, the world had shrunk to the space of a single breath.

Her face was right there. An inch away. Maybe less.

Time slowed. Her dark eyes were wide, fixed on mine. I could feel the warmth of her breath against my lips.

_Soft, warm, and—_

_BZZZZZZT. BZZZZZZT._

A single, sharp buzz from her desk shattered the moment like glass. We both jumped. Rin let go of my feet.

I fell backward, hitting the floor with a dull _thump_. She flopped down a second later with a breathless gasp.

We lay there in an awkward line, staring up at the white ceiling. From here, I couldn't see her face. She couldn't see mine.

An unspoken truce.

For a full minute, neither of us spoke. Neither of us moved.

---

_BZZZZZT._

The phone buzzed again.

“Aren't you going to get that?” I asked.

“It's just Risa,” Rin muttered from the floor.

I rolled onto my side and got to my feet. She still hadn't moved. “So… we're going?”

“Yeah. I said I would.”

I picked up the paper bags and pulled out loose white pants and a matching jacket. I stepped into the pants over my shorts, then zipped the jacket to my chin.

From the floor, Rin stared at me.

“Wait. You had normal clothes this whole time?!”

I adjusted the collar. “Well, I couldn't go outside in just that.”

“But wearing it *here* was fine?”

“Of course,” I said with a gentle smile. “How else would we do our daily stretches?”

Her eyes went wide. “Did you just say *daily*?”

I smiled and offered my hand to help her get up.

She pointedly used the table to pull herself up instead, brushing off her pants without looking at me.

Stubborn. Is this what she meant by *tsundere*? I could see why people found it charming.

---

After a long moment, Rin took a shallow breath and turned toward the door. Each step was careful and measured, as though she were walking across thin ice.

Her hand rose to the doorknob and stopped. Her knuckles turned white as she gripped it, then slowly—so slowly—turned.

The door opened onto the empty hallway, bright and quiet.

I waited for a moment until her breathing steadied. Then, I moved to stand beside her, picking up my laptop backpack and holding it by a single strap.

“Rin, would you mind helping me with this?”

She looked at me, her expression completely flat. “You carried three full bags in here earlier.”

“Yes, well. My arms are rather tired now.”

“Uh-huh.”

Neither of us was fooling anyone.

I held out the other strap. “Perhaps we could carry it together?”

She stared at the strap, then at me. A long moment passed.

“This is ridiculous,” she said.

“I know.”

“You know I know what you're doing.”

“I know.”

Another beat.

“You're lucky you're—” She cut herself off and shook her head. “Never mind. Let's just go.” Then she finally took it. “This is stupid.”

“I know,” I said softly. 

She didn't let go.

We stepped out into the hallway with me holding one strap of my backpack as she gripped the other. 

Risa's door sat at the end of the hall, past a single neighboring door. Fifteen steps, maybe less. 

But for her, that was everything.

I stayed slightly behind, letting her choose the pace. Her shoulders curved inward, her head down, her eyes fixed on that distant door like a lifeline.

One step. Then another. Each one looked like it cost her so much…

Her grip on the strap tightened until I could feel the pull in my own shoulder. Through the fabric, I felt the shake in her hand. Her breathing had changed too, becoming quicker and shallower.

We passed the first door. Halfway there now.

Then she stopped moving.

She was completely still. Her next step started but never finished.

I couldn't see what she was fighting against, but I could see the toll it was taking on her. The way tension locked in every line of her body. The way her back had gone completely rigid. The way her knuckles had failed to hold any tighter. The way her breathing had stopped entirely…

“Rin?” I whispered. “Are you alright?”

She didn't answer. She just stood there, staring at that door that, for her, was so impossibly far away.

Whatever battle she was fighting, I couldn't see it, couldn't reach it, and couldn't help. I felt so useless.
