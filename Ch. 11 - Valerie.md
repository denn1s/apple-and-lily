I nudged the door open with my shoulder, one arm securing two paper bags against my chest. As expected, Rin was at her desk and the usual click-clack of her keyboard was the only sound filling the room.

I walked over to the low table and set the bags down with a soft rustle.

“Is that you, Lily?” she asked without turning.

So, she assumes it’s me now, not Risa. A pleasant warmth spread through my chest. How nice.

 “You’re here early toda—” Rin continued, but her voice cut off when she finally turned. 

She was frozen mid-turn. Her mouth was slightly agape, her eyes wide behind her glasses. But her gaze wasn’t on my face, though. It was fixed, unblinking, right on my stomach.

It’s this top, isn’t it? After all those days of eating nothing but instant noodles and cake, perhaps wearing something so… revealing was a poor choice. I've definitely gained some weight. How terribly embarrassing.

“Well, since we’ve been eating so unhealthily lately,” I said, forcing a bright, cheerful tone into my voice, “I figured we should exercise a bit!”

Rin didn’t respond. Her mouth opened a fraction wider as her gaze slowly drifted down to my shorts. She seemed so concerned. It must be the length; perhaps she finds them too bold. I should put her mind at ease.

Waving a dismissive hand, I added, “Oh, don’t worry, yours doesn’t have shorts. I didn’t think you’d be comfortable in them.”

Her eyes finally snapped up to meet mine. They were wide with what looked like pure panic.

“Wh-what do you mean… *mine*?” she asked, her voice a strangled whisper. I could see a faint sheen of sweat on her brow.

Poor thing. She really must hate the idea of working out.

“I got us matching sets!” I explained. “So we can work out together in the mornings.”

I reached into one of the bags and pulled out a sleek, black athletic shirt with long sleeves.

“I had to guess your size from memory,” I said, holding it up. “But I’m pretty confident this will fit.”

“W-when did I agree to any of this?” she stammered, shaking her head.

She was just being shy.

“Come on,” I said, closing the space between us with an encouraging smile. My fingers found the hem of her oversized hoodie. “Just a few warm-up stretches. It’ll be good for us.”

She yelped and her hands flew down to clutch the fabric, holding it down for dear life.

I tilted my head, my smile unwavering. “Don’t tell me you aren’t wearing anything underneath that?”

“W-what?! Of course I am!”

“Then there’s no problem!” I insisted, giving the hoodie another encouraging tug. “We barely move all day. This will help.”

Her face was a mess of color, her eyes squeezed shut.

"Fine! Fine!" she finally relented. "Just… let go! I'll change, just let me do it by myself."

I released her hoodie and offered her the white paper bag. She snatched it from my hand without a word before disappearing into the bathroom.

The door clicked shut, and for the first time since I'd met her, the room was silent. For a moment, it felt like that very first day I'd visited her room—this library of secrets spread before me, waiting to be explored. 

I let my fingers trail along the spines of the nearest shelf, past titles that promised adventure and romance in equal measure. My eyes wandered upward to the higher shelves, and quickly found the model I'd painted last week, still posed in the same defiant stance I'd left it in. I could already see it flaking at the joints, I really should use a proper primer next time.

A few inches away sat another familiar sight: the unpainted Riri-hime figure with her puffy sleeves and impossibly cheerful curls. A soft chuckle escaped me. Risa insisted on calling me 'Princess' because of this little thing, but looking at that wide, unguarded smile, I couldn't see the resemblance at all.

As I turned from the shelf, the soft glow from the corner of the room finally caught my attention.

Her desk. Her monitor.

Her stories… the one part of this colorful world that was truly, entirely hers. Surely, a little peek couldn't hurt.

I wonder what she’s writing right now?

My eyes moved on their own. I leaned over her chair, careful not to disturb anything, and peeked at the monitor. The screen was filled with a dense block of text, but the incomplete line near the cursor made my breath catch.

_Her eyes fluttered shut as my lips finally met hers, soft, warm and—_

I pulled back from the screen as if it were as hot as my cheeks felt. Soft, warm, and… and _what_?

The sharp _click_ of the doorknob turning sent a jolt of pure panic through me. My heart leaped into my throat. I stumbled backward, catching myself just in time to glide to the center of the room, hoping the blush on my face wasn't as obvious as it felt.

Rin stepped out of the bathroom, and my mind went completely blank. She looked...

### **Study in Contradiction**
>
>_Marble, circa autumn 2025._
> 
>The piece is carved from a single block of white marble, presenting the likeness of a young woman in modern athletic attire. Within the cold permanence of stone, the artist captures a moment of internal conflict, setting clothing against character in quiet tension.
> 
>The figure’s head tilts gently forward, hair bound in a deliberate coil that emphasizes the weight of her downward gaze. The eyes, carved with softened detail behind a pair of round glasses, avoid the viewer's gaze, conveying a profound shyness.
>
>Her arms fold across the body in a gesture that both shields and discloses. The embrace is incomplete, a hesitant defense that paradoxically draws the viewer closer, exposing the tenderness it seeks to conceal.
>
>Her legs are sculpted in a narrow stance, their weight distributed so finely that the entire figure appears balanced on the edge of collapse. This delicate equilibrium is a testament to the sculptor’s technical mastery, capturing fragility without sacrificing stability.
>
>The piece is a contradiction made marble: the desire to vanish versus the certainty of being seen. What emerges is the unforgiving honesty of her presentation, both fragile and unyielding.
>
>But most of all, absolutely entrancing.
>

My trance was broken by the faintest of movements. Her face was still a delicate shade of pink when she opened her mouth and began to speak. my gaze followed the movement of her lips as she formed the quiet words.

_They were soft, warm, and—_

My mind screeched to a halt. I cut the thought off before it could possibly complete itself. No. I was losing my composure. 

I forced a reassuring smile onto my face. “You know,” I said, my voice softer than I intended. “I was right. That fits you perfectly.”

She didn’t seem convinced.

“Alright, let’s find some space,” I said, looking around the room.

We pushed aside the one cushion that never seemed to get used, clearing a small rectangle of floor between the low table and the kitchenette. There wasn’t much room to work with. Maybe next time I could convince her to come to my room instead. If there is one thing that place has in abundance, it’s empty space.

“Okay, you first,” I instructed. “Sit down and spread your legs. Try to reach for your toes.”

Rin sat, her movements as stiff as a new paintbrush. I knelt behind her and placed my hands on the small of her back. Her muscles were wound and tight. Even through the fabric of her shirt, I could feel her tremble slightly at my touch. She must be very tense.

“Just breathe and relax,” I murmured, applying steady pressure. She exhaled in a sharp hiss, leaning forward just a fraction of an inch.

We switched places. When it was my turn, I sat waiting for her hands to land on my back. The silence stretched, and I could almost feel her hesitating behind me. When they finally made contact, her fingers were shaking so much it tickled. A laugh escaped me before I could stop it, and I felt her touch vanish instantly.

“It’s okay, you can touch me,” I said gently. “A little harder, please. I won’t break.”

A defeated sigh escaped her. “Please, don’t start…”

After another moment of hesitation, she pushed, her touch still incredibly light. {But they could stretch regardless?}

“Alright, now stand up,” I said once we were done. “Back-to-back.”

We stood, pressing our backs together. She linked her shaky arms with mine and I could feel her skin was already a little damp. Hopefully, that meant the warm-up was already working.

“My turn first,” I said. “You can be a little rough, I don’t mind.”

“… just don’t.” I heard her mutter, her voice as tight as her back felt.

She leaned forward, pulling me smoothly over her back. I felt a satisfying _pop_ from my spine as some of the tension released.

“There we go,” I said as we straightened up. “Now you.”

I leaned forward, pulling her gently over my back. She was tense at first, but then, suddenly, she went completely limp, draping over me like a rag. She was surprisingly light. 

Wow. Once she relaxes, she’s incredibly flexible.

I slowly stood up straight, carefully setting her back on her feet. She swayed slightly, her eyes glazed over and unfocused.

I waved a hand in front of her face. “Woah, Rin, did you faint while standing up? Are you alright?”

She blinked a few times, shaking her head as if to clear a fog. “I’m… fine.”

“Last one, then,” I said, trying to keep my tone encouraging. “Sit-ups. You can hold my feet.”

I lay down on the floor, and she knelt, placing her hands firmly on my ankles. I took a deep breath, tightened my stomach muscles, and pulled. But I could't rise much. I tried again, this time managing to lift my shoulders a few inches before collapsing back dow. We really aren’t very athletic, are we?

“Come on…” I muttered to myself.

I gritted my teeth, closed my eyes, and put every last bit of strength I had into one final push. My body lurched upward, the momentum carrying me much further than I’d expected. When I open my eyes, her face was right there.

Inches away.

Her eyes were wide with shock. We were both frozen, the air stood still, filled only with the sound of our own breathing. My gaze drifted down from her stunned eyes to her mouth.

_Soft, warm, and—_

_BZZZZZZT. BZZZZZZT._

The loud, insistent vibration from her desk made us both jump. Rin shrieked, letting go of my feet. With no anchor, my body fell backward, and I landed with my back on the floor.

While Rin scrambled for her phone, I just lay there, staring at the ceiling, my heart still hammering against my ribs.

“It’s… it’s a text,” she said from her desk. “From Risa.” She paused. “She’s asking if we’re coming over.”

I sat up slowly. “Well? Do you want to go?”

She turned around. Her face was still flushed a delightful shade of pink.

I softened my voice. “Do you think you’ll be okay?”

Rin took a long, deep breath, squaring her shoulders. It was an impressive, if not entirely convincing, display of resolve. “I’ll be fine. I’ve been there plenty of times.”

She didn’t sound fine at all.
