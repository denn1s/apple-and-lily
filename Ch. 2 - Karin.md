"I want to learn all about this," the girl said, her expression determined in a way that made no sense to me. "Please be my teacher."

My brain just completely shut down.

Because the thing she was holding, the *this* she wanted to learn all about, was a copy of _The Garden of Roses_. A manga so ridiculously explicit I was worried she was going to call the police on me.

What the actual heck.

Okay, Karin. Breathe. Who the hell is this person?

I sized her up. She had long, blonde hair that fell in perfect, glossy curls. You don't get hair like that by accident; that was expensive salon work. Her eyes were a piercing brown that flashed red when they caught the light. She wore a simple white dress, but I'd bet it cost more than my entire collection of limited-edition artbooks.

I'm not a religious person, but in that moment I was pretty sure this is what angels looked like. Or goddesses. Some kind of divine being, anyway. No human being looks that… perfect.  

So what was this perfect specimen of a normie doing in my room?

My eyes wandered to my monitor. The cursor was blinking impatiently at the end of a sentence I was in the middle of writing. That was the really spicy part of the chapter. The part that was definitely not rated for general audiences.

My body moved before my one brain cell could catch up. Pure, overwhelming panic took over. I had to hide the screen. Right now.

I spun my chair around to face her, hoping to block the screen in one smooth move. Instead, I whirled around with all the grace of a drunk penguin, the arm of the chair slamming hard into my desk. The impact sent a shock up my spine and threw my entire body off balance. My center of gravity just disappeared. I was about to fall face-first into this girl's chest like a textbook anime cliche.

Nope. Not happening.

I threw my weight back in a desperate attempt to save myself. It worked, but not in the way I intended. Instead of catching myself, my chair tipped backwards completely, and I went down with it, crashing to the floor. My binder went flying with me. Pages exploded into the air like the world's most mortifying confetti, fluttering down to settle on and around my pathetic, sprawled-out form.

"Oh gods, I'm sorry, I must have startled you. Are you okay?"

Her voice was close now. Way too close. A shadow fell over me, and I cracked an eye open to see her face right above mine.

Is personal space not a thing for normies?

She looked genuinely worried. Her eyebrows were knitted together, and her eyes—they were... no, no time for that.

"I'm fine," I grunted. I was not fine. I was dying of embarrassment.

"Are you sure?" she asked, tilting her head.

Ignoring her, I tried to untangle my limbs and push myself up. When she extended her hand to help, I shook my head quickly—I wasn't in the right mind space for that. She knelt down beside me instead, clutching the manga to her chest with one hand while gathering my scattered notes with the other.

Oh no. Those pages were definitely not safe for innocent eyes... and my own eyes where about to lose their innocence if they kept following the ends of that dress...

"Don't!" I shouted, then quickly added, "I mean—don't worry, I got this!"

In one frantic motion, I lunged forward, snatching the papers from her hand. I scrambled across the floor and started jamming the scattered pages together, crumpling more than a few sheets in my panic. I shoved the messy bundle back into the binder without looking.

"Really, it's fine," I said, trying to make my voice sound less unhinged than what I really was.

Okay. Think, Karin, think. First take a moment to collect yourself. Okay. What do normal people do in these situations?

"Do you... want something to drink?" I asked, finally managing to get to my feet and brush myself off. "You can wait here."

I pointed toward the low table in the center of my room. The girl looked at it, a flicker of confusion crossing her face. She moved toward it and tried to lower herself onto one of the cushions, her stiff movements where screaming, *I have never sat on the floor in my life*.

Once she was settled, my eyes landed on the manga she had placed on the table. My gaze darted from the book to her earnest, but still unsettled face. She said she wanted to learn. But starting with this was like trying to learn surfing by jumping into a tsunami.

Before she could get any ideas, I darted forward, snatched the book off the table, and shoved it back onto a random shelf. I grabbed a different one—_First Blossom_, a story so sweet and innocent it was practically a children's book—and put it in front of her.

"Here, you might like this one better," I said in a shaky voice. "I'll go get those drinks."

I practically ran the few steps needed to reach the kitchen by the entrance, putting as much distance between us as was possible in this tiny room. Well, more than a kitchen, it was really just a glorified counter with a mini-fridge and a sink, but right now it felt like a fortress.

Okay. First things first: drinks. What do you even serve someone like her? She looks like she exclusively drinks mineral water imported from some secret mountain spring in Switzerland. 

Tea? That's what fancy girls always drink in manhwa. I might have some green tea bags somewhere; surely she's used to Earl Grey or some other high-class tea I can't even pronounce. Well, green tea is all I've got, and beggars can't be choosers.

I filled the electric kettle and flipped the switch. Its soft hum was a welcome noise in the suffocating silence. I leaned against the counter, took a deep breath, and tried to force my brain to work.

Alright. I think I've seen her before, maybe in some of my lectures. But seeing her was always more like spotting a celebrity from across a crowded room. You notice them, maybe even admire them from a distance, but the idea of actually talking to them doesn't even cross your mind. Not that I've ever met a celebrity, but you get the point.

The fact is, she's so far removed from a social outcast like me that we might as well be different species. I'd never even considered the possibility of us having a conversation.

So, what was actually going on here?

She probably came for something class-related. That's the only logical explanation. And I, being the social genius that I am, mistook her for Risa and let her in without even looking. Then I had the bright idea of asking her to grab a book for me. _That_ book.

She must have gotten curious about it. A pure, sheltered soul like her has probably never even heard the word "yuri" before, so whatever she saw in that book must have been a complete culture shock for her.

I risked another glance over the counter. She had picked up _First Blossom_ and was carefully turning the pages. As I watched, her eyes widened slightly and her lips parted. I could see emotions quickly flipping one after the other across her face with each new page—surprise, curiosity, maybe even fascination. She was absolutely radiating interest, shining so brightly I had to shield my eyes.

Yup. She's definitely closeted.

The whole scene suddenly made terrifying sense. If that was her first real exposure to girls liking other girls, of course she'd be acting this strange. You'd think in this day and age people would figure this stuff out sooner, but I guess rich families try to keep their kids in a bubble. Wouldn't want to run out of family heirs, right?

I let out a long, drawn out breath that had been trapped in my chest. My heart was still pounding, but it helped me relax a little.

She could definitely use some help. I'd been there myself once.

Okay, let's make a plan. I'll be her "teacher" for a day, as she wanted. I could set her up with some easy-to-read, introductory-level manga. The safe stuff. Let her dip her toes in the water, see how it feels. Then, I'll give her a simple way to test her feelings, a small task to help her figure things out. Finally, I'll send her on her way and we'll never have to see each other again.

With her looks, she'll surely have no issues getting a girl. Or ten. Life can be so unfair.

Armed with a plan, I walked back to the table, trying to channel the cool, older sister persona from my latest fanfic. Calm, in control, slightly mysterious. I placed the two mismatched mugs on the table with what I hoped was sophisticated elegance.

The girl picked up her cheap cup with such natural, effortless grace that my entire persona just shattered in an instant.

Deep breadths Karin... Keep it cool.

"So," I began, trying to pull myself back together. "How was the book?"

She looked up. "It was very well illustrated," she said, her voice full of genuine admiration. "Did you draw it?"

My brain stalled for a second.

"No," I said. "That's a professional's work. I'm... more on the amateur side of things. And I'm a writer, not an illustrator."

"That's so impressive!" she said, her smile widening. "Can I read something you've written?"

Nope. Absolutely not. "Sure," I said, then I mentally slapped myself. "But maybe after you've read a bit more. To get used to the genre, you know?" My writing was definitely not beginner-friendly. 

I stood up and walked over to my collection of "safe for work" doujinshi. As I ran my finger along the spines, I called over my shoulder, "What caught your eye in the book you just read? Anything specific?"

After a moment of thinking, she answered. "There seemed to be a lot of hand holding," she said.

I nodded to myself. Of course. The classic. I pulled out a few thin volumes. "Take these home with you," I said, turning back to her.

My own mention of "home" made me pause. "Where are you staying, anyway?"

"Oh, in the room next door," she said simply.

I stared at her. "Here?" I asked. That was a surprise. "In this old dorm? The one that's practically falling apart?"

She just blinked at me. "It's not that bad."

Ah, of course. The room next to mine. The one everyone called the "Princess Room." I gave the girl another look. Very fitting.

That room was the largest in the building, the only one that had been renovated recently. The Grand Sage—our dorm mother—supposedly charged an exorbitant amount for it. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that our rent was cheap thanks to that one room.

"Right. Well, in that case, you can just give these back whenever." I placed the small stack of books on the table. "So, hand holding, huh?"

She nodded, but looked a bit confused.

"As your teacher," I said, once again trying to fall into the role, "I'll give you a task."

She immediately straightened up, her expression turning serious.

"Find one of your girl friends," I instructed. "Hold her hand, and look directly into her eyes for ten seconds. Then, you'll report back to me. Okay?"

That should do the trick. Not that I could claim to be any more experienced on the subject; at most I had years of reading and writing about it. But that had to count for something, right?

She nodded once, completely solemn. "Would any girl do?"

What a weird question. As always, the social life of normies was a complete mystery to me. She probably had so many girls to pick from that she was struggling to choose. What a way to eat bread in front of the hungry. 

"Of course," I said.

"Very well," she said, a determined glint in her eye as she stood up. "Best to get it out of the way."

She turned and moved to the empty cushion right next to me. In that single, horrifying moment, I understood the catastrophic nature of my mistake.

"Can I?" she asked, holding her hand out. To me.

No no no no no no no.

"Sure," I heard my own traitorous voice say. 

I swear I heard the crack in my facade.

She smiled, pleased, and smoothly took both of my hands in hers.

A jolt, electric and hot, shot through me. Her hands were soft. And warm. 

The instant I felt her warmth, my hands ignited. I could feel the burning heat rising like molten lava from my palms, crawling through my veins, scalding a path up my arms and into my neck. I couldn't let her see it.

_Why did I have to tell her to keep eye contact?_

Her face grew closer and closer. I couldn't look away. I couldn't stop the blush. This was a losing battle. She was staring right at me. Those impossibly red eyes weren't just looking, they were _drilling_. Directly into my soul, right where I kept all my embarrassing secrets. Hell, it was like she'd found the door to the freaking Treasury of Babylon, but it was filled with every cringey, degenerate thought I'd ever had. And it was dang full.

The space between us collapsed. Her eyes, like bloody rubies, crept closer. I wanted to run... but they were so gosh darn beautiful.

Those eyes. They were so clear. So focused. They were going to see everything.

*Thump.*

My lungs seized the last dregs of air hitched in my throat.

*Thump.*

My vision darkened, tunneling down to two burning points of red.

*Thump.*

And then everything went black.

That's the last thing I remember from the night I met her.
