“I want to learn all about this,” the girl said, her expression determined in a way that made absolutely no sense to me. “Please be my teacher.”

My brain just completely shut down.

Because the thing she was holding, the *this* she wanted to learn all about, was a copy of _The Garden of Roses_. A yuri manga so ridiculously explicit I was worried she was going to call the police on me.

What the actual heck.

Okay, Karin. Breathe. Who the hell is this person?

I sized her up. She had long, blonde hair that fell in perfect, glossy curls. You don't get hair like that easily; that was expensive salon work. Her eyes were a piercing brown that flashed red when they caught the right light. She wore a simple white dress, but I'd bet it cost more than my entire collection of limited-edition art books.

I'm not a religious person, but in that moment I was pretty sure this is what angels looked like. Or goddesses. Some kind of divine being, anyway. No human being looks that… perfect.  

So what was this perfect specimen of a normie doing in my room?

My eyes wandered to my monitor. The cursor was blinking impatiently at the end of a sentence I was in the middle of writing. That was the really spicy part of the chapter. The part that was definitely not rated for general audiences.

My body moved before my one brain cell could catch up. Pure, overwhelming panic took over. I had to hide the screen. Right now.

I spun my chair around to face her, hoping to block the screen in one smooth move. Instead, I whirled around with all the grace of a drunk penguin, the arm of the chair slamming hard into my desk. The impact sent a shock up my spine and threw my entire body off balance. My center of gravity just disappeared. I was about to fall face-first into this girl's chest like a textbook anime cliché.

Nope. Not happening.

I threw my weight back in a desperate attempt to save myself. It worked a bit too well… Instead of catching myself, my chair tipped backwards completely, and I went down with it, crashing to the floor. My binder went flying with me. Pages exploded into the air like the world's most mortifying confetti, fluttering down to settle on and around my pathetic, sprawled-out self.

“Oh gods, I'm sorry, I must have startled you. Are you okay?”

“I'm fine,” I grunted. I was not fine. I was dying of embarrassment.

“Are you sure?” she asked, tilting her head, then knelt down to grab some pages.

*That skirt is definitely too short for that.* 

I turned away fast, trying to save what little dignity I could salvage, but the instant I did, I remembered those pages were definitely not safe for innocent eyes…

“Stop right there!” I blurted, not meaning to shout. “—Sorry, I mean, don’t peek. I’ll handle it.”

In one frantic motion, I lunged forward, snatching the papers from her hand. I scrambled across the floor and started jamming the scattered pages together, crumpling more than a few sheets in my panic. I shoved the messy bundle back into the binder without looking.

“Really, it's fine,” I said, trying to make my voice sound less unhinged than what I really was.

Okay. Think, Karin, think. First, take a moment to collect yourself. Okay. What do normal people do in these situations?

“Do you… want something to drink?” I asked, finally managing to get to my feet and brush myself off. “You can wait here.”

I pointed toward the kotatsu. When the girl looked at it, a flicker of confusion crossed her face. She got close and clumsily tried to lower herself onto one of the cushions, her stiff movements where screaming, *I have never sat on the floor in my life*.

Once she was settled, my eyes landed on the manga she had placed on the table. My gaze darted from the book to her earnest but still unsettled face. She said she wanted to learn. But starting with this was like trying to learn surfing by jumping into a tsunami.

Before she could get any ideas, I darted forward, snatched the book off the table, and shoved it back onto a random shelf. I grabbed a different one—_First Blossom_, a story so sweet and innocent it was practically a children's book—and put it in front of her.

“Here, you might like this one better,” I said with a cracking voice. “I'll go get those drinks.”

I practically ran the few steps needed to reach the kitchen by the entrance, putting as much distance between us as was possible in this tiny room. Well, more than a kitchen, it was really just a glorified counter with a mini-fridge and a sink, but right now it felt like a fortress.

Okay. First things first: drinks. What do you even serve someone like her? She looks like she exclusively drinks mineral water imported from some secret mountain spring in Switzerland. 

Tea? That's what fancy girls always drink in manhwa. I might have some green tea bags somewhere; surely she's used to Earl Grey or some other high-class tea I can't even pronounce. Well, green tea is all I've got, and beggars can't be choosers.

I filled the electric kettle and flipped the switch. Its soft hum was a welcome noise in the suffocating silence. I leaned against the counter, took a deep breath, and tried to force my brain to work.

Alright. I think I've seen her before, maybe in some of my lectures. But seeing her was always more like spotting a celebrity from across a crowded room. The fact is, she's so far removed from a social outcast like me that we might as well be different species. I'd never even considered the possibility of us having a conversation.

So, what was actually going on here?

Did she hear about me from someone? Not to hype myself up, but I have gotten pretty famous lately. Well, in some specific fanfic circles, that is… But a high-class normie like her might have the right connections to find out.

That has to be it. She came here because she would like to learn about girls liking girls from a well-known author. 

I nodded to myself as I risked another glance over the counter. She had picked up _First Blossom_ and was carefully turning the pages. As I watched, her eyes widened slightly and her lips parted. I could see emotions quickly flipping one after the other across her face with each new page. She was absolutely radiating interest, shining so brightly I had to shield my eyes.

Yup. She's definitely closeted.

The whole scene suddenly made terrifying sense. If *The Garden of Roses* was her first real exposure to the idea of a girl liking another girl, of course she'd be acting this strange. You'd think in this day and age people would figure this stuff out sooner, but I guess rich families try to keep their kids in a bubble. Wouldn't want to run out of family heirs, right?

I let out a long, drawn-out breath that had been trapped in my chest. My heart was still pounding, but it helped me relax a little.

She could absolutely use some help. I'd been there myself. Everyone has.

Alright. She wanted a teacher? She would get one. I straightened my back, pushing my glasses firmly up my nose. It was time for Ringo-sensei to make an appearance.

I walked back to the table, channeling the cool author persona I used when writing. I placed the two mismatched mugs on the table with what I hoped was sophisticated elegance.

Showtime.

“So!” I started. “You want me to teach you about… ehm… Yuri. Right?” 

Crap. That almost made me blush; this is more embarrassing than it seemed. 

The girl tilted her head, a flicker of confusion in her eyes, but she nodded anyway.

Right. Teacher mode. I leaned over and snatched a stray sheet of paper and a pencil that had fallen during my earlier catastrophe. It was time to fully embrace the role. “Alright!” I announced, trying to sound confident. “We are starting from Lesson 1.”

I smoothed out the crumpled paper and wrote at the top in my neatest handwriting, which was, admittedly, not the best

_Ringo-sensei's Yuri Lessons_.

The girl took a sip of her tea. She looked absurdly perfect, a goddess sipping from my cheap mug.

Focus, Karin… Keep it cool. You can do this. Just make up a simple task for her to test her feelings. Then send her on her way, and we'll never have to see each other again. With her looks, she'll surely have no issues getting a girl. Or ten. Life can be so unfair.

As I was lost in my thoughts, she tilted her head again. “What's Ringo-sensei?”

“Oh, just my writer name,” I said, waving dismissively. “Nothing important.”

“Ohhh!” she said, her smile widening. “Can I read something you've written?”

Nope. Absolutely not. “Sure,” I said, then mentally slapped myself. “But maybe after you've read a bit more. To get used to the genre, you know?” My writing was definitely not beginner-friendly. “For now, let's just focus on the lesson.”

I tapped the pencil on the paper, trying to look thoughtful. I had no idea where to start.

“Okay,” I tried again. “What caught your eye in the book you just read? Anything specific?”

She thought for a moment. “There seemed to be a lot of hand-holding,” she said finally. 

A classic. The perfect, simple trope to get a beginner's heart racing. And the perfect task to get her perfect self out of my hair. 

“Excellent,” I said. “If you wish to truly understand the significance of something like that, reading isn't enough. It's important to try things out for yourself.”

“Go find one of your girl friends,” I continued, pointing at her with the pencil. “Hold her hand, and look directly into her eyes for ten seconds. Then, you'll report back to me what you felt.”

She went silent for a moment. Her arms folded across her chest, and she looked down, her brow furrowed in deep concentration. The intensity in her expression was almost unnerving. Suddenly, she looked up. Her eyes met mine, and for a single frame, I swear I saw a flicker of pure red flash through her eyes over a most concerning smirk. But it vanished instantly. 

“Would any girl do?”

What a weird question. As always, the social life of normies was a complete mystery to me. She probably had so many girls to pick from that she was struggling to choose. What a way to eat bread in front of the hungry. 

“Of course,” I said.

“Very well,” she said, a determined glint in her eye as she stood up. “Best to get it over with.”

I nodded, expecting her to walk toward the door. Instead, she turned and moved to the empty cushion right next to me. In that single, horrifying moment, I saw the catastrophic failure of my flawless logic.

“Can I?” she asked, holding her hand out. **To me.**

_No no no no no no no._

“Sure,” my own traitorous voice said.

The instant our hands touched, the cool, confident mask of Ringo-sensei didn't just crack. It exploded into dust.

She smiled, pleased, and smoothly took both of my hands in hers.

An electric jolt shot through me in that instant. Her hands were soft. And warm. 

My hands ignited. I could feel the burning heat rising like molten lava from my palms, crawling through my veins, scalding a path up my arms and into my neck. I couldn't let her see it.

_Why did I have to tell her to keep eye contact?_

Her face grew closer and closer. I couldn't look away. I couldn't stop the blush. This was a losing battle. She was staring right at me. Those impossibly red eyes weren't just looking—they were _drilling_. 

Directly into my soul.

Right where I kept all my embarrassing secrets. Hell, it was like she'd found the door to the freaking Treasury of Babylon, but it was filled with every cringey, degenerate thought I'd ever had. And it was dang full.

The space between us collapsed. Her eyes, like bloody rubies, crept closer. I wanted to run… but they were so gosh darn beautiful.

Those eyes. They were so clear. So focused. They were going to see everything.

*Thump.*

My lungs seized the last dregs of air hitched in my throat.

*Thump.*

My vision darkened, tunneling down to two burning points of red.

*Thump.*

And then everything went black.


That's the last thing I remember from the night I met her.
