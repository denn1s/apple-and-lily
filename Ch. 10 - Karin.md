My hand was on her shoulder. Her bare shoulder. My brain took a full second to process the input before the conclusion hit me with the force of a photon torpedo: I had, without any warning, just hugged Lily.

_Captain's Log, supplemental. In retrospect, one might say that I was overconfident. I had grown too used to their presence and had let my guard down at the worst possible time._

…

_Sir! Unplanned physical contact initiated! All social shields are down!_

_Do not try to pull away, I repeat. Do not try to pull away._

_But sir! Proximity levels are critical! We will overheat in approximately four seconds if we don't break contact now. Structural integrity is failing!_

_It would be too embarrassing to pull out now. I'm not sure that we can even take another hit to our reputation at this point. Hold it._

_Sir! Three seconds to overheat! Flustering has reached visible levels! It's reached neck sectors 14 to 17!_

_Ugh. Very well, increase the angle of the arm just enough to break contact without alerting them._

_Two seconds! One second… contact broken! It seems to have worked, sir! Heat levels are stabilizing._

_Good job. Now continue the conversation like nothing happened. Put her on screen._

My arm was now hovering in the air, not quite touching her stupidly gorgeous shoulders but still caging her in a deeply awkward semi-huddle. My throat was dry. I had to physically unstick my tongue from the roof of my mouth to force out any sound before the silence suffocated me.

“S-so… ehm… Y-you know how we haven’t been able to… to s-study? Like, at all?”

Lily was too close. Impossibly close. From this range, I could see how microscopically perfect her skin really was.

She nodded. The simple movement made a lock of her blonde hair swing forward, the strands so close they threatened to brush against my cheek.

_Keep it steady. Just turn away slowly. We can't withstand eye contact at this point._

“W-well,” I stammered. “We… I m-mean, you… you should ask Risa! For help! In e-exchange for… p-painting.”

Did that even make sense? My heart was hammering against my ribs so hard I couldn’t even hear my own words over the noise.

Suddenly, a wave of warmth tickled my right ear as Lily’s lips made every nerve ending stand at attention at once. She whispered…

“I love it.”

_DIRECT HIT! Hull breach on starboard!_

_There's a major breach in sectors one through nine! Brace for impact! Core meltdown imminent!_

_So this is as far as we go… It has been an honor to serve with you all._

My body reacted before my brain could. I shoved myself backward with the force of a small explosion, my back slamming into the wall behind me with a loud smack.

What? What just happened?

I slumped against the plaster, blinking. My right ear was burning, and I could still feel traces of her breath on my skin. My dazed eyes found Lily first. She was watching me with that infuriatingly clueless smile. But that wasn't even the worst part. Oh no. The worst came when my terrified gaze finally found Risa.

She had a soft, tender, almost motherly smile on her face as she looked between the two of us. {consider something like "like a damned mother" or something cruder}

"My," she said, her voice dripping with mock sweetness. "It's nice to see that the Baka-couple is doing so well..."
