My hand was on her shoulder.

Her _bare_ shoulder.

My brain stalled for a full second before the realization hit me with the force of a photon torpedo.

Without any warning, I had just hugged Lily.

_Captain's Log, supplemental. In retrospect, one might say that I was overconfident. I had grown too used to their presence and had let my guard down at the worst possible time._

…

_Sir! Unplanned physical contact initiated! All social shields are down!_

_Do not try to pull away, I repeat. Do not try to pull away._

_But sir! Proximity levels are critical! We will overheat in approximately four seconds if we don't break contact now. Structural integrity is failing!_

_It would be too embarrassing to pull out now! We can't take another hit to our reputation at this point! Hold it._

_Sir! Three seconds to overheat! Flustering has reached visible levels! It's reached neck sectors 14 to 17!_

_Ugh. Very well, increase the angle of the arm just enough to break contact without alerting them._

_Two seconds! One second… contact broken! It seems to have worked, sir! Heat levels are stabilizing._

_Good job. Now continue the conversation like nothing happened. Put her on screen._

My arm was now hovering in the air, not quite touching her stupidly gorgeous shoulders but still trapping her in a deeply awkward semi-huddle. My throat was dry. I had to break the suffocating silence before it crushed me completely.

“S-so… ehm… Y-you know how we haven’t been able to… to s-study? Like, at all?”

Lily was too close. Impossibly close. From this range, I could see how microscopically perfect her skin really was.

She nodded. The simple movement made a lock of her blonde hair swing forward, the strands so close they threatened to brush against my cheek.

_Keep it steady. Just turn away slowly. We can't withstand eye contact at this point._

“W-well,” I stammered. “We… I m-mean, you… you should ask Risa! For help! In e-exchange for… m-modeling for her.”

Did that even make sense? My heart was hammering against my ribs so hard I couldn’t even hear my own words.

Then, a puff of warm air tickled my ear. Her lips brushed against my skin as she whispered.

“I love it.”

_DIRECT HIT! Hull breach on starboard!_

_There's a major breach in sectors one through nine! Brace for impact! Core meltdown imminent!_

_So this is as far as we go… It has been an honor to serve with you all._

My body reacted before my brain could. I shoved myself backward with the force of a small explosion, my back slamming into the wall behind me with a loud smack.

What? What just happened?

I could still feel the burning heat in my ear when my mind went blank.


### A Lady's Touch
>
**Pairings:** Noble Lady/Poor Girl 
**Tags:** Yuri, Fluff, Otome Isekai, First Meeting, Touch-Starved, Class Difference 
**Summary:** A beautiful noble lady finds a poor girl in the street and offers her a kindness she's never known before.
>
_A shadow fell over her. She looked up to see a noble lady crouching before her, a vision of silk and jewels that seemed to glow against the grime of the outer city. She was beautiful, so beautiful it made the poor girl's breath catch in her throat._
>
_"Are you hurt?" the noble lady asked._
>
_Dazed by such radiance, the poor girl could only shake her head mutely, her gaze fixed on the lady's concerned eyes._
>
_"Good," the lady said with a gentle smile as she offered a hand. For a moment, the poor girl could only stare at the outstretched palm, a stark contrast to her own dirt-stained fingers. When the girl didn't move, the lady simply reached down, her warm fingers wrapping  around hers. The poor girl flinched; she couldn't remember the last time she had felt the warmth of another person's touch._
>
_Once she was upright, the noble lady began to uselessly dust the poor girl's ragged clothes, not caring in the slightest as filth smudged her own expensive gown._
>
_"Shall we go?" the noble lady asked, her hand still holding the poor girl's. It was then, feeling the precious warmth in her palm, that the poor girl decided she would stay by this lady's side for as long as she would have her._
>

Lily guided me by the hand and gently let me back down to my spot in the kotatsu. 

"My," Risa said, her voice deceptively sweet. "It's nice to see the Baka-couple is doing so well."

Risa's voice finally broke me from my daze. Wait wait? 

Lily, a picture of innocence, looked from Risa’s triumphant grin to me.

"Couple?" she asked, her head tilting. "Are you referring to us working on the model kit together?"

I shook my head. Couple? Who and who?

"Oh, Princess," Risa sighed, her voice full of pity. "My sweet, sweet summer child."

Lily blinked. "Thank you? But then… what does *Baka* mean?"

"It's simple! **Va**-lerie and **Ka**-rin. **Va**-**Ka**. Baka!" Risa beamed, looking far too proud of herself.

Lily's eyes widened slightly. "Oh! Like a portmanteau. That's quite clever."

Risa’s words echoed in my still stunned brain. _Baka-couple._

I let out a defeated groan, burying my face in my hands. "Dammit," I muttered into my palms. "That's so good I'm not even mad."

"But why is she in the lead position?" I asked, dropping my hands to aim a finger at Lily. I had to reclaim some ground.

A delicate blush rose on Lily's cheeks. She looked timidly as she turned to me with round eyes.

"Well…" she said quietly. "To be honest, I'm rather… *inexperienced*."

Risa snorted.

… *She’s talking about the garage kit Right?* 

Risa propped her cheek on her palm. "I don't know about that, Princess," she said. "You can be very… *assertive* when you want to be."

"Perhaps." Lily looked down. Her blush deepened into a proper flush. "But for my first time… I'd be more comfortable letting someone more *experienced* take the lead."

My face felt like it was actively melting off my skull. She is talking about the garage kit. She is talking about the garage kit. SHE IS TALKING ABOUT THE GARAGE KIT.

"That's not what I meant!" I yelped at Risa. "It's just, in these pairings, isn't the airhead character supposed to be more… you know… more *passive*?"

Risa scoffed. "Passive? Please. Our Princess is clearly a *hands-on* learner."

Lily stared at her ridiculously slender fingers as she flexed them. "I know I can be quite good with my hands," she said thoughtfully. "But something like this is more about proper… _technique_, isn't it?"

_CAN SOMEONE PLEASE USE A FREAKING SUBJECT?!_

Risa's shoulders started to shake as she bit her lip, trying desperately to smother a laugh.

"So," Risa choked out, her voice cracking with the effort. "What you're saying is, you'd like Sensei to… to show you her _technique_ first?"

That was it. I slammed my fist on the table. "THE GARAGE KIT!" I yelled, pointing a trembling finger at the damned figure on the table. "WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE GODDAMN GARAGE KIT, RIGHT?!"

Lily just looked at me, her expression one of perfect, unblemished innocence. "Of course," she said. "What else would we be talking about?"

A beat of silence passed. Then Risa broke, letting out a loud snort that devolved into outright cackling. I sagged against my cushion, the tension draining out of me so fast I felt dizzy.

Lily nodded, then looked directly at me with a serene smile. "Still, Rin. If you enjoy _leading_ that much, you should have just said so. I really don't mind if you go first."

The relief didn't just vanish. It was ripped out of me, leaving a hollow void in my chest.

"...For the project... right?" My voice was a faint whisper.

Her smile widened, becoming infuriatingly bright. "Of course!"

_... Goddammit._

That broke the dam. Risa absolutely lost it, collapsing backward and pounding a fist on the floor as she howled with laughter, tears streaming down her face. I just let my head fall forward, resting it against the cool surface of the table, utterly and completely defeated.

After a moment, Lily, completely unfazed by the emotional carnage she'd just caused, stood up and stretched gracefully. "Oh well. It's getting late. I'll go get us some lunch." She glanced down at my collapsed form. "The usual for you, Rin?"

Still half face-down, I gave her something like a nod.

She then turned to Risa, who was wiping tears from her eyes and trying to catch her breath. "Risa, would you like some as well?"

Risa had a wide grin still plastered on her face. "Sure, Princess. But I'll have to take it to go. My evening classes start soon."

"I'll get you something easy to carry, then."

---

The door clicked shut.

In the sudden absence of chaos, the only sounds left were the last of Risa’s chuckles. She wiped a tear from the corner of her eye, pushing herself up from the floor with a lingering grin.

"Wow, Sensei," she said, stretching her arms above her head. "Already got the little princess trained to fetch. I'm impressed."

"It's not like that," I mumbled into the table. "I think she's just… trying to help."

"Help?" Risa’s stretching stopped, her arms slowly lowering. The smile vanished from her face.

I kept my head down but gave a small, miserable nod. A beat of silence passed as the full implication landed on her.

Risa’s breath hitched. "No way," she whispered, her voice full of disbelief. "You actually told her?"

*Honestly, I’m as surprised as she is.*

"I didn't mean to," I admitted, my voice quiet. "It just slipped out."

I finally lifted my head to meet her eyes. "It’s been getting worse. Before, just going outside the dorm was enough to make me freeze up. Now even leaving this room feels like a fight." I took in some air. "And I’m losing."

The smirk on Risa’s face faltered, then vanished completely. She straightened up, her posture losing its lazy slouch as she met my gaze with a familiar deep-set concern I knew all too well.

"Karin… I'm so sorry." She sighed, running a hand over her arm. "I was the one who pushed you to come here. I really thought getting you out of your parents' house would help."

At this rate, this year will just be a repeat of the last. My world limited to just this one room.

"It's not your fault." I told her. "And you know I hate it when people make a big deal out of it."

Risa held my gaze for a moment longer, until the seriousness on her face melted away, replaced by a familiar smirk.

"Oh?" she teased. "But _she's_ allowed to make a big deal out of it?"

She leaned forward, aiming a sickeningly sweet smile at the unpainted Riri-hime figure as her finger traced the outline of its non-existent hair.

I scoffed. "She's just a busybody. Like all the others."

Risa pushed herself to her feet, picking up the figure. She walked over to a bookshelf and carefully placed the statue back in its empty spot, nestled in front of a row of novels.

Only then did she turn back to me, leaning against the shelf with her arms crossed. But her teasing smirk was not gone.

"So, how are things _really_ going on with Princess?" Risa asked.

I pulled my knees to my chest, hugging them. "Nothing's 'going on'," I said, my voice barely over a whisper. "She's just using this room as her new private library, and I just happen to come with it."

*It's all just the new thing she found "fascinating". Next month, it'll be pottery or something.*

"Let's be real, Risa. Someone like her wouldn't look twice at someone like me."

*She might as well be an actual princess.*

Risa hummed, turning to scan the crowded bookshelves. "Is that really it?" she asked. 

She pulled a book from the shelf, clearly just for show, and flipped it open to a random page. She stared at the text for a minute.

"She does know you're into girls, right?"

Of course, she knows. I'm the tour guide for her latest obsession.

Still facing the shelves, Risa continued, not caring for my answer. "And she knows about your… condition."

She flipped a couple of pages, as if she where reading a freaking law book and not some random smut. 

“And yet,” she said. “Despite knowing all of your so-called faults, she keeps coming back.” And with that, she snapped the book shut.

*She keeps coming back.*

The echo of those words brought that damn heat back to my cheeks and I couldn't stop it in time.

When I met Risa's eyes, a cat-like grin had already spread across her face. Satisfied, she slid the book back onto the shelf.

"I'd say you're doing pretty damn well, Sensei."

Risa's victorious grin widened. She strolled back to the kotatsu and settled onto her cushion, giving me a moment to stew in my embarrassment before mercifully changing the subject.

"Anyway," she said. "I wonder what she's bringing back. Probably something fancy from that cafe downtown, right?"

A small smile touched my lips.

*Risa might be able to read me like a freaking book, but on this, I had her beat.*

"Probably cake," I said, my voice full of a confidence I hadn't felt all day.

Risa paused. "... You mean, for dessert?"

"Nope," I said, enjoying the genuine confusion on her face. "Just cake."

*That's just how she is.*

Risa just shook her head slowly. "Ugh. Cake? For lunch? God, my empty stomach is going to riot."

A real, honest-to-god chuckle escaped me.

She let out a long, dramatic sigh, slumping back. "And here I thought having her around might actually improve your garbage eating habits."


Just as the words left her mouth, the door slid open.

Lily walked in holding a paper bag that was way too fancy to belong anywhere near this room.

“I’m back,” she said cheerfully. “Sorry for the wait, the line was long.”

She pulled three white boxes and put them on the counter. I could smell the sugar from here.

_Called it._ A smug little grin tugged at my lips.

Risa stared like she’d just seen the gates of heaven creak open, but quickly shook it off. 

"Welcome back, Princess! We were just talking about you."  

My foot shot out under the table, smacking square into her shin. 

"Alright, alright," she wheezed, rubbing her leg. "Message received. Anyway, I really gotta dip. Evening class is coming up."  

Lily, ever the gracious host in someone else's damn room, looked at Risa as if she'd kicked a puppy. "Awwww, that's too bad. I got you the cutest little strawberry sponge cake."

I didn't miss Risa's twitch. "I'll take it to go, but this old lady needs something with actual substance for lunch."

Lily's expression turned thoughtful, completely missing the point. "I see. Well, I'll be sure to get you a larger portion next time, then."

Risa’s smile twitched. I couldn't help it when a snort of laughter escaped me. It was nice to see Risa on the receiving end of Lily's weaponized cluelessness for a change.

Lily held the cake box out like an offering, but as Risa’s fingers were about to close around it, she retracted it.

"Risa," she said. "Before you go... I was hoping I could ask for your help with our classes."

Risa's interest was clearly piqued. She playfully launched her hand to grab the box. "Of course! Anything for my two cute little kouhai. With what?"

"Well..." Lily said. "Everything."

Risa didn't miss a beat. "Say no more. Bring your laptop over to my room on Sunday. I'll get you set up with some good stuff."

To my surprise, Lily didn't immediately agree. Her gaze shifted back to me for a second. "Okay," she said finally. "We'll see."

*Wait. Is she actually hesitating… for my sake?*

Risa either didn't notice the exchange or chose to ignore it. She finally took the cake box from Lily with a nod. "Alright, I'm out for real now. See you later!"

She slid the door open but paused at the threshold, turning back to flash us one last, wicked grin.

"Try not to have too much fun with your... ehm... *project*."

And with that, she was gone.

---

Lily came back to the kotatsu and dropped the two remaining cake boxes on the table. She took her usual spot on the cushion next to me, tucking her legs up all neat and proper. 

She turned her attention to her box. I watched her out of the corner of my eye, expecting her to just open it. Instead, she fumbled with it, tilting it awkwardly to try to pry open the flaps on the bottom. What the hell was she doing?

Then she paused, both hands flat on top like she was about to perform some magic trick. With this little flourish, she lifted the whole box straight up, revealing a slice of cake sitting on its cardboard plate.

Oh, I get it. She was doing that thing Risa did earlier today with the garage kit. The whole dramatic reveal.

A silent clap of her hands confirmed it. She was ridiculously pleased with herself.

*And here comes her little one-woman show.*

By now, I knew well what would come next. She wouldn't just dig in like any sane person would. No. She'd stare at it first. And sure enough, that's exactly what she did. Her head tilted, and those brown eyes traced every damn detail as if it was a work of art. Christ, the intensity was giving me secondhand embarrassment.

Then, after a full minute or so, she’d pick up her fork. Her first bite was always just a tiny piece from the corner, like she didn’t want to ruin the aesthetics of her slice. And of course, today was no exception—she cut her piece, dragged it to her lips, and did the whole eye-shut routine.

And then the shiver started.

She always did this full-body quiver that started in her shoulders and made her ears tremble. A shudder of pure bliss. It was like watching one of those cooking anime moments where they ascend to food heaven or whatever. Maybe her clothes will explode one of these days.

I shook my head, dismissing the image before it went too far. Time to move.

Before she could even open her eyes, I leaned over and stabbed my fork into the far corner of her cake. Took a piece and swallowed it before I even tasted it.

If I didn’t, her fork would be headed straight for my mouth next.

Then, before she could get any other bright ideas, I cut a piece from my own cake and slid it onto the edge of her cardboard plate.

When she opened her eyes, she finally noticed the piece I had traded. Her mouth was still full, but she started making these muffled sounds while pointing at where I'd taken my bite. "Mm! Mmm-hmm?" That meant "Wasn't it good?" in normal people speak. 

I nodded quickly. If I didn't, she'd probably try to feed me another bite herself. With her fork.

After that, as always, she’d finally turn to her own lunch, and I could have some peace.

I watched her eat for a bit longer, completely lost in her world of sugary bliss. Each bite followed the same process. Observe, cut, lift, savor, repeat. She'd pause after bites too, like she was giving each one its proper respect or something. It was ridiculous. Who the hell eats cake like that? And yet, I couldn't look away. 

My own slice sat there, almost completely untouched. Yet somehow, just watching her, made me feel full in a different way.
