My hand was on her shoulder.

Her _bare_ shoulder.

My brain stalled for a full second before the realization hit me with the force of a photon torpedo.

Without any warning, I had just hugged Lily.

_Captain's Log, supplemental. In retrospect, one might say that I was overconfident. I had grown too used to their presence and had let my guard down at the worst possible time._

…

_Sir! Unplanned physical contact initiated! All social shields are down!_

_Do not try to pull away, I repeat. Do not try to pull away._

_But sir! Proximity levels are critical! We will overheat in approximately four seconds if we don't break contact now. Structural integrity is failing!_

_It would be too embarrassing to pull out now! We can't take another hit to our reputation at this point! Hold it._

_Sir! Three seconds to overheat! Flustering has reached visible levels! It's reached neck sectors 14 to 17!_

_Ugh. Very well, increase the angle of the arm just enough to break contact without alerting them._

_Two seconds! One second… contact broken! It seems to have worked, sir! Heat levels are stabilizing._

_Good job. Now continue the conversation like nothing happened. Put her on screen._

My arm was now hovering in the air, not quite touching her stupidly gorgeous shoulders but still trapping her in a deeply awkward semi-huddle. My throat was dry. I had to break the suffocating silence before it crushed me completely.

“S-so… ehm… Y-you know how we haven’t been able to… to s-study? Like, at all?”

Lily was too close. Impossibly close. From this range, I could see how microscopically perfect her skin really was.

She nodded. The simple movement made a lock of her blonde hair swing forward, the strands so close they threatened to brush against my cheek.

_Keep it steady. Just turn away slowly. We can't withstand eye contact at this point._

“W-well,” I stammered. “We… I m-mean, you… you should ask Risa! For help! In e-exchange for… m-modeling for her.”

Did that even make sense? My heart was hammering against my ribs so hard I couldn’t even hear my own words.

Then, a puff of warm air tickled my ear. Her lips brushed against my skin as she whispered.

“I love it.”

_DIRECT HIT! Hull breach on starboard!_

_There's a major breach in sectors one through nine! Brace for impact! Core meltdown imminent!_

_So this is as far as we go… It has been an honor to serve with you all._

My body reacted before my brain could. I shoved myself backward with the force of a small explosion, my back slamming into the wall behind me with a loud smack.

What? What just happened?

I slumped against the plaster, blinking. My entire right ear was on fire, and I could still feel traces of her breath on my skin. My dazed eyes found Lily first. She was watching me with that infuriatingly clueless smile. But that wasn't even the worst part. Oh no.The true horror came when my gaze finally landed on Risa.

She was looking at me with the gentle, loving smile of a damned mother watching her daughter take her first steps. My blood ran cold. 

"Excuse me, Risa," Lily's voice seemed to cut through a thick haze around me. "Rin here was telling me you could help us with our classes?"

"Of course I'll help my two cute underclassmen!" Risa's voice sounded distant and entirely too cheerful.

My gaze was fixed on a meaningless spot on the floor when a pair of fancy shoes entered my vision. I followed them up. Lily was standing over me, offering a hand.

"What do you need help with?" Risa continued, her voice still sounding miles away.

My own hand lifted, moving on instinct. It stopped just short of hers as my brain caught up, but it was too late.

"Like... everything," Lily said, her tone unconcerned.

She closed the remaining distance grabbed my hand and pulled. 

_Of course she doesn't hesitate. Normies like her are probably used to grabbing girl's hands._ 
"That bad, huh?" Risa asked.

I felt a series of light thumps against my shoulders. Lily was carefully dusting off my hoodie. Which was completely unnecessary, by the way.

"That bad," Lily confirmed with a nod. "We've been trying to study together, but you see... we keep getting distracted."

Risa’s grin was audible in her voice. "_Distracted_, eh?"

Satisfied with her work, Lily took my arm and simply steered me the few steps back to the kotatsu. A light pressure on my shoulders had me sitting on my cushion before I’d fully processed anything that had just happened.

"Sure!" Risa said. "I don't have classes tomorrow, why don't you bring your laptop to my room? I'll set you up with some cool stuff."

My head tilted up. Risa was watching us, and that soft, motherly smile hadn't left her face. 

"That would be a big help. Thanks," Lily replied, taking her seat.

Risa’s gaze lingered on us for a moment longer, her smile softening into something that promised I would never know peace again.

"My," Risa said, her voice deceptively sweet. "It's nice to see the Baka-couple is doing so well."

The words echoed in the sudden silence. *Baka-couple*.

Lily, a picture of innocence, looked from Risa’s triumphant grin to me.

"Couple?" she asked, her head tilting. "Are you referring to us working on the model kit together?"

Thank god. Thank every deity in the pantheon. Her denseness is a shield.

"Oh, Princess," Risa sighed, her voice full of pity. "My sweet, sweet summer child."

Lily blinked. "Thank you? But then… what does *Baka* mean?"

"It's simple! **Va**-lerie and **Ka**-rin. **Va**-**Ka**. Baka!" Risa beamed, looking far too proud of herself.

Lily's eyes widened slightly. "Oh! Like a portmanteau. That's quite clever."

I let out a defeated groan, burying my face in my hands. "Dammit," I muttered into my palms. "That's so good I'm not even mad."

"But why is she in the lead position?" I asked, dropping my hands to aim a finger at Lily. I had to reclaim some ground.

A delicate blush rose on Lily's cheeks. She looked timidly as she turned to me with round eyes.

"Well…" she said quietly. "To be honest, I'm rather… *inexperienced*."

Risa snorted.

… *She’s talking about the garage kit Right?* 

Risa propped her cheek on her palm. "I don't know about that, Princess," she said. "You can be very… *assertive* when you want to be."

"Perhaps." Lily looked down. Her blush deepened into a proper flush. "But for my first time… I'd be more comfortable letting someone more *experienced* take the lead."

My face felt like it was actively melting off my skull. She is talking about the garage kit. She is talking about the garage kit. SHE IS TALKING ABOUT THE GARAGE KIT.

"That's not what I meant!" I yelped at Risa. "It's just, in these pairings, isn't the airhead character supposed to be more… you know… more *passive*?"

Risa scoffed. "Passive? Please. Our Princess is clearly a *hands-on* learner."

Lily stared at her ridiculously slender fingers as she flexed them. "I know I can be quite good with my hands," she said thoughtfully. "But something like this is more about proper… _technique_, isn't it?"

_CAN SOMEONE PLEASE USE A FREAKING SUBJECT?!_

Risa's shoulders started to shake as she bit her lip, trying desperately to smother a laugh.

"So," Risa choked out, her voice cracking with the effort. "What you're saying is, you'd like Sensei to… to show you her _technique_ first?"

That was it. I slammed my fist on the table. "THE GARAGE KIT!" I yelled, pointing a trembling finger at the damned figure on the table. "WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE GODDAMN GARAGE KIT, RIGHT?!"

Lily just looked at me, her expression one of perfect, unblemished innocence. "Of course," she said. "What else would we be talking about?"

A beat of silence passed. Then Risa broke, letting out a loud snort that devolved into outright cackling. I sagged against my cushion, the tension draining out of me so fast I felt dizzy.

Lily nodded, then looked directly at me with a serene smile. "Still, Rin. If you enjoy _leading_ that much, you should have just said so. I really don't mind if you go first."

The relief didn't just vanish. It was ripped out of me, leaving a hollow void in my chest.

"...For the project... right?" My voice was a faint whisper.

Her smile widened, becoming infuriatingly bright. "Of course!"

_... Goddammit._

That broke the dam. Risa absolutely lost it, collapsing backward and pounding a fist on the floor as she howled with laughter, tears streaming down her face. I just let my head fall forward, resting it against the cool surface of the table, utterly and completely defeated.

After a moment, Lily, completely unfazed by the emotional carnage she'd just caused, stood up and stretched gracefully. "Oh well. It's getting late. I'll go get us some lunch." She glanced down at my collapsed form. "The usual for you, Rin?"

Still half face-down, I gave her something like a nod.

She then turned to Risa, who was wiping tears from her eyes and trying to catch her breath. "Risa, would you like some as well?"

Risa had a wide grin still plastered on her face. "Sure, Princess. But I'll have to take it to go. My evening classes start soon."

"I'll get you something easy to carry, then."
