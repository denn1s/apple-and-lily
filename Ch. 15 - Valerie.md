“Shouldn’t you be going to class already?” the girl on my back asked.

But I didn't answer. Instead, I pulled on her arms until her feet left the floor, our balance tipping forward as we stretched together. She definitely sounded more relaxed today. Her usual complaints came out almost casual, without the edge they usually had.

I couldn't help but smile. 

Still, she never missed an opportunity to try and slip away from our workouts; that part hadn't changed. I held the stretch for a moment longer before straightening up and letting her feet back in the ground.

Then she took her turn. As my toes lifted off the floor, I said, "I'm not going today." My voice came out slightly muffled with my head hanging upside down. She lowered me back slowly, and I heard her let out a long breath she'd apparently been holding.

"Alright, turn around and try to reach for your toes."

Rin turned to face away from me. I knelt behind her and gently held her calves. She started to bend forward, but her fingertips barely made it past her knees before she stopped. After a moment, she tilted her head to peek back at me through the gap between her legs, upside down.

Our eyes met for an instant before she looked away quickly, pretending to focus on the floor.

“You know,” she said, her voice a touch unsteady, “I thought you’d be more of a tryhard about skipping class.”

I stood and placed both hands on her back. "Well, somebody here is definitely not trying hard enough," I said, pressing her down gently until her fingers finally brushed her feet.

A groan escaped her. It was sharp at first, then settled into what seemed like relief. I held the pressure steady for another moment before letting up.

"I suppose I did try harder back in high school," I admitted. "With my studies, I mean. But things were different back then."

For *her*, even something as simple as morning stretches would have been too *undignified*. "My turn," I said, dismissing the thought.

Now I faced away from her and felt her hands settle hesitantly on my calves. Then I bent forward, letting my arms hang loose. I didn’t quite reach my toes, but they went definitely further than my knees. Through the space between my legs, I could see Rin again.

She was staring right at me and her eyes went wide the second we made eye contact.

I gave her a smile.

Her face turned bright red and she looked away immediately, muttering something I couldn't quite hear. A moment later, I felt her hands leave my calves. She stood and placed her palms on my back. 

Her touch was so light it barely registered.

"T-then..." she started, her voice shaky as she pushed down just a little harder. "Since you're n-not going to class, shouldn't we be studying? You keep saying the finals are getting closer..."

She was changing the subject. But she was also right. We really should get to work.

I tried to recall what was next on our little list. Oh, sit-ups. A sudden warmth crept into my cheeks. That particular exercise had been… and interesting experience. It might be too difficult for us right now. We never did manage to complete a single one, after all. Yes, for now, sit-ups are forbidden.

A surprised squeal escaped her, high-pitched and utterly charming. Her face immediately flushed a lovely shade of pink as her eyes narrowed in mock anger. She lunged forward, her index finger aimed right for my side in a clear act of revenge.

But her hand froze midway, caught by her own hesitation. She pulled it back, her gaze darting away as the blush on her cheeks deepened. A small pout formed on my lips.

“Coward…” I whispered, just loud enough for her to hear.

She didn’t deny it, just stood there, wonderfully flustered.

{Add a small recall to the shorts in this scene}

---

I turned away to give her a moment, crossing the room to my desk. We would need my laptop, but where could we possibly work? The room's stark emptiness offered few options. My desk only had a single chair, and sharing it would be… inefficient. We’d never get any actual studying done. The floor was hardly a better choice. My gaze then fell on my bed, the covers pulled taut without a single wrinkle. It would have to do. {consider a callback to how Valerie's made was well made because that's how her mother liked it}

I grabbed the laptop and turned back. Rin was still standing awkwardly in the center of the room, looking small and out of place.

“Are you still doing alright?” I asked, trying to not sound as concerned as I felt.

She jumped slightly, snapping out of her daze. “Huh? Oh, yeah. No problem.”

There was a tiny tremor in her voice, but I didn't press. It had been my idea to move our morning stretches in here, after all. 

You wouldn’t know it from how calm she seemed now, but just moments ago, she had frozen at the threshold of my open door. I watched her take a single, deep breath before giving a small nod to herself and bravely stepping into the foreign territory of my room.

“But wow,” she said as she scanned the bare walls. “There really is nothing here. Do you actually live here?”

I turned to her with an exaggerated pout. “Well, I’m _terribly_ sorry my room isn't to your standards.”

She immediately started waving her hands in front of her. “Oh no, no, I didn’t mean it like that! It’s actually… kind of nice? Quiet.” She paused, tilting her head. “I just thought you’d have a bunch of paintings or something.”

To Rin, a room must be a doorway to its owner’s heart, and it seemed that what remained of mine was but this barren space. How fitting.

“I don’t have any anymore,” I said with a light shrug. “I got rid of them before moving here.”

Karin’s smile faltered, her brow furrowing with a hint of concern.

Maybe, just maybe, for someone so easily overwhelmed by the world, this quiet emptiness could be a refuge. The warm thought bloomed unexpected in my chest. If this barren space could be a safe harbor for her, then perhaps its emptiness wasn't just a flaw.

I walked over to the bed stopped for a moment, just looking at the perfectly smooth covers—a testament to years of my mother's discipline. Then, I let myself fall onto it. A soft _whoosh_ of air escaped the mattress as the pristine fabric crumpled under my weight. The sight of the new wrinkles sent a rebellious thrill through me. {needs more physicality, a laugh maybe}

Patting the mattress beside me, I gave her a bright smile. “Come on, there’s plenty of room.”

She let out a hesitant laugh. “I could just… go grab my chair. Or we could, you know, do this back in my room—”

“It’s a laptop, isn’t it?” I interrupted. “It belongs on a lap.” It was perfectly reasonable.

With a sigh of defeat, she gave in and sat down very carefully, keeping as much distance between us as the mattress would allow. I opened the laptop, then quietly slid closer until our knees were just touching. She stiffened instantly, scooting a few inches away.

A tiny smirk played at the corner of my lips as I kept my eyes fixed on the screen.

“Coward,” I murmured, making sure it was just loud enough for her to hear.
{consider removing this, i was trying to make a theme out of *coward* but i'm not sure if it lands}

She pretended she hadn't, her gaze glued to the glowing screen, but the tips of her ears turned a lovely, betraying shade of pink.

---

Rin let out a small cough, a nervous sound that tried to clear the air. “Anyway,” she said, her eyes fixed determinedly on the laptop. “Can I check the program Risa installed?”

“Of course,” I replied, my voice bright. I slid the computer from my lap onto hers, using the motion as an excuse to scoot closer until our shoulders were nearly touching. She tensed for a moment but didn't pull away this time.

The program was a simple text editor, much like the one I'd tried using before, but with a  chat window running along the side. “So… we just ask it what we want?” she murmured. She typed a short command into the chat: _Write a simple program that says hello._

A second later, the main panel filled with code. She hit run and small output window appeared. 

_hello_

Rin blinked and I did as well. “Well, that’s certainly… useful,” I said.

She was still focused on the screen, but my own interest was already fading fast. This was tedious. A mischievous thought took root. 

“You know, it’s missing something,” I announced, leaning in to take the laptop from her lap before she could object. “Let me just fix it.”

I typed a new command into the chat: _Make it cuter._

The code changed, and when I ran it again, the a new output appeared:

_hello ♡ ♡_

I beamed at the screen, filled with a sense of small victory. Rin let out a long-suffering sigh and gently reclaimed the laptop, inching a little farther away.

“We should actually focus,” she said, her gaze returning to the screen. “What was the assignment again?”

“Which one…?” I asked, my voice laced with a hint of wry humor. We really were behind.

“Let’s just start from the first one,” she said, her voice deadpan. “They’re never strict about the deadlines in these courses, anyway.”

A small smile played on my lips. I wondered when she’d had the chance to discover that, considering I’d never once seen her in a lecture hall. Regardless, she was right.

The first assignment had been a simple text-to-speech program. Rin typed the request into the chat, and once again, the code appeared in an instant. She ran it.

“Hello,” a flat, robotic voice echoed in the quiet of my room.

I stared at the screen, an odd sense of emptiness washing over me. It worked perfectly. There were no mistakes to fix, no challenges to overcome. All I could think was how profoundly it was lacking.

“Heh,” Rin said with a half-laugh, breaking the silence. “This is so easy it’s almost boring, isn’t it?”

I looked up, startled. She had voiced my exact thought. A deep, genuine warmth spread through my chest, so potent it almost took my breath away. A real smile broke across my face. A kindred spirit.

The connection sparked my next impulse. In one smooth motion, I took the laptop from her lap again, my grin full of mischief. “Then let’s make it better.”

I angled the screen away, typing quickly into the chat before she could see. _From now on, make the program’s output exaggerate any text it’s given._

Sharing this moment with her helped, but the task at hand was still dreadfully dull. We needed a new objective, something more interesting than just making a robot talk. 

“I have a better idea. A new game. We make it give each other a compliment,” I said, and before she could argue, I typed my own line.

_I think that tracksuit suits you._

The computer voice said, “I think that tracksuit looks absolutely fantastic on you!”

I blinked, a little surprised myself.

_Well, that worked better than expected._ 

I pushed the laptop gently back towards her, nudging myself a little closer as I did. “Your turn.”

“Do I have to?” she asked, her voice small. “I thought you didn’t like compliments.”

She was right to be cautious. But compliments about my art, were one thing. This was different. This was just a game. “It’s fine,” I said with a soft smile. “I already gave you one, it’s only fair.”

She hesitated for another long moment before her fingers moved carefully across the keyboard. She hit enter.

The robotic voice filled the room, impossibly cheerful. “Your eyes are the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen!”

I froze for a theatrical beat, but the warmth that flooded my cheeks was surprisingly real. I quickly pressed my cool palms to my face, letting a laugh bubble up to cover the moment. “Wow,” I managed, peeking through my fingers. “I had no idea you felt so strongly, Rin.”

“W-what? That’s not what I wrote!” she sputtered, her hands flying to the keyboard to delete the evidence.

“Oh no you don’t,” I laughed, snatching the laptop from her lap before she could see my handiwork.

“Hey!” she cried, lunging to get it back.

I leaned away, holding it just out of her reach. For a moment we were tangled in a playful tug-of-war, her shoulder pressing against my chest as she strained for the computer. She was too close.

_This is dangerous._

With a guilty-sounding laugh, I relinquished my grip. The sudden release sent me flopping backward onto the bed as she pulled the laptop back into her lap, her face still a delightful scarlet.

_So, my eyes, huh?_

--- 

I stayed where I had landed, flat on my back, my gaze lost in the blank white canvas of the ceiling. I turned my head slightly. Rin was still at the edge of the bed with my laptop in her lap, typing with a quiet diligence as she finished the assignment. A soft smile touched my lips. There was something deeply peaceful about seeing her so at home in my quiet space.

“So, what’s the second assignment anyway?” Rin asked, breaking the comfortable silence. “Might as well get them all done.”

My eyes drifted shut. “Mm… the Q&A program, I think,” I said, my voice lazy. “We had to make it ask questions and take the answers as text.”

“So we just chat with it?”

“Pretty much.”

The typing started again. I opened my eyes just enough to watch her from where I lay. Her head tilted slightly as she read whatever the program was telling her on the screen, then her fingers moved again. She pushed her glasses up with her middle finger, as she often did back in her room, never looking away from the laptop. There was something calming about watching her work. 

After a while, she spoke. "Okay. Question one: What's your favorite color?" She glanced over at me, clearly expecting a quick answer.

But I hesitated. I used to like blues—calm, obedient colors that never argued back. But now... My mind drifted to the girl at the edge of my bed and all the lovely colors she turned when embarrassed.

"Red, I think," I said softly.

She stopped typing. "Huh. I would've pegged you for pink."

I smiled, thinking of the shade that appeared on her cheeks so often. "Pink works too."

A moment passed as she typed my answer in. I felt warmth creeping into my own face and looked back up at the ceiling.

"Next question," she said. "Favorite food." Before I could even think of an answer, a small grin spread across her face. "I'll just type in cake."

I groaned softly. "Unfair. You can't answer for me."

"Prove me wrong then," she teased, fingers already moving across the keys.

I let my hand rest on my stomach. We really had been eating a lot of cake lately, hadn't we? The waistband of my shorts was definitely tighter than I expected for this size.

"You're probably right anyway," I admitted with a sigh.

A small, victorious grin spread across her face as she finished typing "cake." She looked entirely too pleased with herself.

After that, she went quiet for a moment, staring at the laptop screen. When she finally spoke, her voice was more serious.

"Last question. Where did you go to high school?"

I hesitated. Color and food had been simple, general questions. But this one felt... different. More specific. Maybe this was her real question. Sadly, I didn't have an interesting answer for her. 

“Just a regular all-girls academy uptown.”

Nothing special. Just boring and proper and exactly what was expected of me.

“Sounds fancy,” she said, her tone softening. Then, almost as an afterthought, she added, “What was it like?”

The question hung in the air for a moment. "It was fine, I guess," I said finally. "Quiet. I just kind of... followed what everyone else was doing. Everyone was very proper."

I paused. Wait. What _had_ I done in high school?

I tried to remember something from those years. A single, distinct memory, a face, a conversation, a moment that stood out. But... nothing. All I could remember was the complete boredom I felt. Just the routine. Wake up, class, lessons, practice, sleep. That was all that remained and everything else was a blur.

A cold thought crept into my mind. If Mother pulled me from university, would my life become that indistinct blur once more? A future of just following orders until all the days blended together into one long, gray smear.

But then, another even more unsettling thought followed. What if I stayed? What if I dutifully passed these courses, followed the path everyone expected? Wouldn't the result be just the same? Another colorless victory that meant nothing.

My throat tightened. The gray smear of my future felt so real, so inevitable, that for a moment, I couldn't breathe. It was a cold, suffocating feeling, the one I had run all this way to escape.

A soft touch on my knee broke the spell. I blinked, my eyes finding Rin's. She was looking at me, her playful mood gone, replaced by a quiet, genuine concern.

“Hey,” she said softly. “You okay? You looked… really far away.”

Her voice was the anchor that pulled me back from the edge. I looked at her, truly looked at her—at the worried expression in her dark eyes, the chaotic spill of her hair... The single greatest source of color in my monochrome world. A grounding warmth spread through my chest, chasing away the chill.

I managed a small, reassuring smile. “I’m fine. Just remembering.”

She held my gaze for a second longer, as if deciding whether to believe me, before giving a small nod. She turned back to the screen, gently changing the subject. “So… were you in any clubs? Art maybe?”

“Not really,” I said, my voice still a little distant. “I left early most days. I had lessons at home.”

"I see..." She looked at the screen pensively. “So, what should I write for your high school? You never told me the name.”

I let out a soft snort, a small spark of my usual self returning. “Write: ‘Absolutely Tedious.’”

She looked at me for a long moment, then a slow, understanding smile spread across her face as she typed it in. I found myself returning it with a small, genuine smile of my own.

---

My mind felt like a tangled knot of code. I’d had enough programming for one day. Enough of the soulless world of text editors and robotic voices.

Then suddenly, a bright and mischievous impulse cut through the fog. I sat up sharply on the bed.

“Wait here,” I said, not giving Rin a chance to ask questions as I quickly hopped off the mattress and disappeared into my walk-in closet, leaving her staring after me with a wonderfully confused expression.

I moved through the hangers in my closet quickly, hunting for what I needed.

_This is so dumb._

My fingers brushed past dresses and blouses until they found what I was looking for: a gray office skirt and a matching blazer I hadn't touched since I bought them. I held them up. 

_Utterly, completely ridiculous._

I saw it in one of Rin’s books once. A girl was trying to help her friends study, so she put on glasses and dressed up like a school teacher. It *was* ridiculous, a complete caricature, but in the story, it had worked. And most importantly, it looked fun.

_This is absurd. Cringey. Embarrassing._

Yes. It was all those things, and I knew it. But maybe the only way to add color to my life again was to paint myself in the wild, graceless hues of foolish joy.

And I knew exactly who had the most interesting colors to show me.

I pulled the skirt on over my shorts and slipped the blazer over my gym top. 

My eyes fell on the open box of brushes, carelessly left on the closet shelf, and I smiled.

One brush to hold my hair. Another as a pointer.

I took one last embarrassed breath, then stepped out of the closet.

---

Karin was still on the bed, exactly where I'd left her.

As her eyes landed on me, the color slowly drained from her face, leaving her pale. Her eyes grew wide behind her glasses, her mouth falling slightly open. I could see her visibly trembling.

A small giggle escaped me. Oh, this was already worth it. Her reactions were simply the best.

"Well, since we can't seem to focus..."

Her eyes did a slow scan, from the brush on my hair, to the blazer, down to the ridiculous skirt. A bead of cold sweat was clearly visible on her temple as she swallowed hard.

I smiled brightly. 

"I thought I should try calling on Lily-sensei!"
