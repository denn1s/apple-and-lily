Through the fabric of my hood, through the silence of the headphones, through the haze that had blurred the whole world; only her hand remained clear.

So I took it.

The warmth I felt pushed back against the cold lurking just beyond my focus. As long as I held onto it—no, as long as I held onto *her*—the panic couldn't find me.

I forced my stupid feet out of the car while I still could.

One step. Then another. I kept my eyes down, where it was safe. Dark asphalt spread out beneath me.

I drew in a breath. Held it. Then released it carefully.

Okay. I could do this.

My foot touched down. For a heartbeat, everything was fine.

And then the ground disappeared.

It was impossibly far away. I could see my foot on the pavement, but my body screamed I was falling through empty space.

I did the only thing I could. I grabbed Lily's arm, holding on for dear life. 

I was being ridiculous, I knew that, but she was all I had.

And she didn't pull away. She didn't even flinch.

I focused on that. On her. On her steady arm beneath my hands. On her warm presence beside me. 

Lily just waited. She let me stand there until the world stopped spinning.

Eventually, we started to move.

I felt so weak. So pathetic.

I couldn't even cross a damn parking lot. Something any toddler could manage without a second thought. My fingers dug deeper into Lily's arm, and I hated myself for it. But I couldn't make myself let go.

She could feel how hard I was gripping. She had to realize what a burden I was. How much effort it took to drag me ten stupid feet.

So why wasn't she letting go?

Her arm stayed steady beneath my grip. Her pace never changed.

The ground shifted to concrete beneath my shuffling steps, and still, she walked beside me. Steady. Confident even. Everything I couldn't be.

My hands ached. But I couldn't let go. Not even a little. Because if I loosened my hold, she might finally understand what I was. Someone broken. Someone who couldn't function without clinging to another person just to move forward.

Will she leave now if I let go?

I held tighter.

Then, I felt warmth settled over my hands.

Lily's free hand covered mine. It felt gentle against my desperate grip.

She was still here.

Something in my chest loosened and I could breathe again.

We kept walking. One foot in front of the other. The concrete gave way to smooth tile somewhere along the way, but I barely registered it. I just focused on breathing, on moving, on the warmth of her hand over mine.

Her pace slowed. Then stopped.

"We're here," she said softly. "You made it."

Made it. I actually made it.

My hands were still locked around her arm, trembling now from exhaustion and leftover fear, and maybe from something else.

She'd stayed. Through all of that, she'd stayed.

Lily pushed open a door, and we stepped inside. The classroom was empty and quiet. 

At the front of the class I saw a woman sorting through some papers at the desk. Her head was down, focused on her work.

I quickly let go of Lily's arm before she could look up and see. Red marks remained where my fingers had been. 

Oh god. I did that.

My stomach twisted. I opened my mouth to apologize, but Lily smiled at me before I could get the words out.

She reached up and carefully pulled my headphones off, letting them rest around my neck. Her fingers were warm against my ears for just a second.

She wasn't mad.

She guided me toward a desk near the front, her hand light on my back. I sank into the chair, grateful to finally stop.

{watch out for the overuse of She, but it might work to transmit a tired/hipnotized mind}

Lily walked up to the desk, and the woman looked up with a warm smile.

"Valerie, Miss Connelly," she said, her eyes moving between us.

I managed a small nod, my throat too tight for words.

"How have you both been?" she asked, though her attention settled on Lily. "The semester's wrapping up soon—I imagine you're both keeping busy."

"Busy as always," Lily replied with ease. "How is your husband's back? Is it still bothering him?"

"It's much better, thank you for asking. The therapy is finally helping."

They talked like old friends. The kind of casual conversation I could never manage with anyone.

I stopped trying to follow what they were saying and just watched instead. Lily smiled at something the professor said. Nodded. Replied with something that made the professor laugh. She looked comfortable. Used to talking with others like this. 

So this is where Lily spent the mornings when she was not in my room.

I let my gaze drift around the classroom. It was bigger than I remembered from the couple times I'd actually made it to a lecture. Rows and rows of desks stretched back toward tall windows. How many students sat in these seats every day? Twenty? Thirty? Did they all come to class every day?

On the days she didn't come to my room, this is where she was. Sitting at one of these desks, taking notes, talking to professors and classmates. Not the girl who wore ridiculous costumes in my room or teased me until I couldn't think straight. This was someone who knew how to move through the world, who could arrange impossible things with a smile and the right words. {this needs fixing its a bit complex}

She'd really done all this. For me.

The professor glanced at the clock on the wall. "I think it's about time," she said gently.

"Thank you again, Professor Harris," Lily said. "I really can't tell you how much this means."

"It's no trouble at all, dear." The professor smiled. "I'm happy I could help."

How many conversations had this taken? How many favors called in? How much planning, just to get me here?

The professor walked over to my desk with the first test in her hands and set it down gently in front of me. 

"We'll start with math," she said softly. "Take all the time you need, Miss Connelly. There's no rush."

I managed a small nod.

Lily walked to the door, then paused with her hand on the frame.

"Good luck, Rin," she said quietly. "I'll be right here waiting when you're done."

The door clicked shut behind her.

And I was alone.

The test sat in front of me. Mathematics Final Exam. I'd been so sure I'd never get here—that my world would keep shrinking until I couldn't even reach the door, that I'd fail out with a string of zeros and incomplete.

But Lily had refused to let that happen. She'd walked me across that parking lot when I couldn't do it alone. She'd arranged all of this, fought for this chance when I'd already given up on myself.

I couldn't let it go to waste.

My hand shook as I picked up the pencil.

_One step at a time._

"Welcome back!"

Risa stood in the hallway, her arms as wide as her grin. Before I could say anything, she pulled me into a hug—which wasn't really like her. "You did good," she said against my ear.

She stepped back, clearing her throat. "Alright. Come on. We're celebrating."

The three of us walked down the hall together. The overhead were already on. They had that dim, late-evening feel. My legs felt like they might give out any second, but I kept putting one foot in front of the other.

"I got the perfect drink to celebrate tonight," Risa said, looking way too pleased with herself.

Lily glanced over. "You do know we're not old enough to drink yet, right?"

"Relax, Princess. It's non-alcoholic." Risa grinned. "Had to pull some strings to get it, though."

Lily raised an eyebrow. "What kind of strings?"

"You'll see. It's a surprise." Risa's grin widened.

Before I knew it, we were standing at my door.

"Alright, you two make yourselves comfortable. But not _too_ comfortable." She shot us a grin. "I'm grabbing the drinks. Be back in five."

I pushed through the door and made a beeline for the cushion by the bed. Dropped down and let my back hit the mattress. Didn't even try to sit up properly.

Done. I was done.

All the tension finally drained out. My shoulders dropped, the shaking in my hands finally stopped and my eyes drifted shut. The cushion was soft beneath me. The room was warm and quiet and safe.

I was home.

When I opened my eyes again, Lily was at the kotatsu with her head resting on her arms. Her breathing was slow and she looked exhausted.

"Hey," I said. "Thank you. For everything."

Lily didn't lift her head. "You already said that. Like five times on the way back."

"I mean it."

"I know." She said with a small, tired smile. "It's okay. I really didn't do that much."

"You did everything," I said.

"Hardly." She closed her eye again. "That was all you."

I didn't know what to say to that. "I-Is there anything I can do? Like to pay you back?"

She was quiet for a moment. "I might need your help with my sister sometime soon, probably."

"Sure. Anything."

A sister. I didn't even know Lily had a sister. She never really talked about her family. Come to think of it, I barely knew anything about her.

The door swung open and Risa walked in with a bottle in one hand and some bags of snacks in the other. "How rare!" she announced. "Not finding you two all over each other."

Lily lifted her head just enough to give her a look. "That only happened once..."

"Twice actually," Risa muttered as she dropped down at the table. "But whatever. Today we celebrate." She set the bottle down with a soft thunk. "Sweet sake. Its non-alcoholic. Hard to find around here." She said smugly.

I blinked at the bottle. "Sake? Really?"

"The sweet kind," Risa said, pulling out paper cups. "Since you two can't do alcohol." She poured some into a cup and slid it across to me. "Never tried it myself, but its supposed to be good."

The liquid was cloudy, almost milky white. I picked up the cup.

Risa poured another and pushed it toward Lily, then one for herself.

I took a sip. It was warm and sweet without being sugary. It went down smoothly, and I felt the warmth spread through my chest. My eyes wanted to close again. Everything in my body just wanted to melt into the floor and stay there.

"Good?" Risa asked.

I nodded.

"It's very sweet," Lily said. "I like it."

"Figured you would. You've got a serious sweet tooth, Princess."

I let my head fall back against the bed and closed my eyes.

"So," Risa said, her tone turning playful. "I heard you two were getting pretty cozy on campus today."

Lily made a small noise of dismay. "How do you already know about that?"

"I have my sources." Risa's grin was audible. "You're kind of famous among the first years, you know."

"Oh no." Lily sounded mortified. "They're going to ask me so many questions..."

Their voices kept going back and forth. I stopped trying to follow what they were saying and just let the words wash over me. Risa said something, Lily laughed. Lily said something back and Risa gasped, acting all dramatic.

Risa refilled the cups and opened the snack bags. They kept talking—about Lily's classes, then Risa's latest project, then about 3D modeling. The room was warm. The cushion was soft. My eyes kept closing on their own.

When I opened them again, Risa was gathering the paper cups and Lily was folding up empty snack bags.

"Alright, bedtime for this old lady," Risa announced as she stretched.

Lily stood and gave me a small wave. "Goodnight, Rin."

Risa followed her out with that all-knowing smile.

The door clicked shut.

I stayed on the floor for another minute, or maybe ten. Until I finally dragged myself up and stumbled to bed. Didn't bother changing. Just fell face-first into the pillow.

It had been such a long day.

But I'd made it through.

---

I couldn't sleep.

My body was exhausted, but my mind wouldn't shut off. 

I could still feel the warmth of her hand. I looked at my hand in the darkness.

I rolled over to face the wall. Lily was on the other side. Just a few inches away, sleeping in her own room.

She'd picked out my clothes. Done my makeup. Got me those headphones. Arranged a damn limousine and a private exam room.

But that wasn't even all of it.

She'd started leaving the door open weeks ago. Those morning stretches she insisted on were to help me. Getting me to visit her room. She's been doing all that just to help me prepare. 

Not only that, but helping with groceries and lunches. Bringing me class notes. The group projects. Even studying with me.

How much had she done that I hadn't even noticed?

How can someone be that kind. That selfless.

That beautiful.

...

I love her, don't I?

I covered my eyes. It was so simple, so obvious. It had been there the whole time, just waiting for me to stop pretending I didn't know.

I could feel the heat from my face in my arm.

I love her. 

But she can never know.
