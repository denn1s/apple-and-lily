The moment we stepped into the hallway, a timer started in my head.

Lily left my door open behind us. I saw it out of the corner of my eye. That helped. A little.

My hand clamped down on the backpack strap. Somehow, the feeling of the rough fabric digging into my palm felt calming. It was something to hold on to.

Risa’s room was right there. Not far. Just one door down. You've been there many times. You've been in this hallway many times.

_One step. Just start with one._

My foot slid forward. It felt heavy, like I was dragging it through wet concrete. The light in the hallways felt harsh and I had to keep my head down, my eyes fixed on the door.

_Don’t look anywhere else. Just the door._

I could feel Lily next to me, the slight tension on the strap made her a constant presence. I was walking too slow. She must think I'm pathetic. 

But she was matching my pace... She already knows. It’s fine.

I squeezed the strap until my knuckles burned. It was the only thing keeping my hand from shaking.

_Almost there._

A loud roar that seemed to come from the air itself surrounded me. The walls seemed to lean in, pressing on me. Suddenly, I could barely tell were I was. The hallway was too empty. Too bright.

My feet stopped. They just stopped. Bolted to the floor.

_No. Move. Just a few more steps. Please._

But my legs wouldn’t listen. The roar was deafening now, drowning everything out.

A voice cut through the noise. It was soft and gentle, but miles away.

“Rin? Are you alright?”

I held on to the strap even harder, focusing on the weight behind it. And it helped. It felt grounding.

I forced a breath in, then put every ounce of my will into my right foot.

It lifted. An inch. Then another.

Then the left.

Each step was a victory. Each step was agony.

The wood on Risa’s door came into focus. The metal of the doorknob. My free hand reached out, trembling, and touched the cool, solid surface.

I made it.

The strength vanished from my legs all at once. I leaned my entire weight against the door, letting go of everything but the strap.

---

The door swung open and I practically fell inside, stumbling over a stray motherboard. Risa’s room was the same disaster zone as always. That is, a minefield of computer parts and tangled wires covering every surface. The state of it was familiar, almost comforting.

_Christ, Risa. How does it keep getting worse?_

I glanced over at Lily. Her eyes were wide, sparkling like she’d just walked into a new treasure vault. Great. Now she's found a new playground. I wonder how long it will be until she gets tired of visiting my boring corner of the dorm.

“Well, well. Look what the cat dragged in,” Risa said from across the room. She spun in her gaming chair to face us. “If it isn’t my favorite Baka-couple. And in matching tracksuits, too. How cute.”

“Can it, Risa,” I shot back without any real heat. “I’m not in the mood for your crap today.”

I didn’t even look at her. My one and only goal was her bed, or at least the mountain of metallic junk where her bed was supposed to be. Or, what I assumed was still her bed, buried under a mountain of heat sinks, fans, and what looked like the casing for an old PC.

“Hello, Risa,” Lily said politely. “Your room is… amazing.”

“Right? So, Princess, ready for your first lesson in 3D modeling?”

Their voices already sounded distant, like they were coming through water. I ignored them, focused on the bed. Shoving a pile of junk off the mattress, I barely registered the loud clatter it made on the floor.

_Does she even sleep in here? Or does she just curl up on a pile of spare parts like a dragon on its hoard?_

“Oh, well, I actually came for help with my classes…” Lily said.

“Yeah, yeah, we'll get to that,” Risa said. “First things first. Grab that mouse over there.”

I carved out a small space and flopped onto my stomach, burying my face in a pillow that smelled like metal and dust. The world narrowed to that small patch of darkness and I felt like I could finally breathe. I still could hear Risa and Lily talking, but their words were muffled. I pulled the pillow over my head and the sound vanished completely.

Finally. Quiet. The heavy weariness in my bones took over, and I let myself sink into the peaceful void between awake and asleep.

---

Onstage, a **LOWKEY KARIN** in a judge's robe banged a wooden gavel. Next to her, a **CYNICAL KARIN** rolled her eyes, looking profoundly bored as she examined her nails.

_Order! Order!_ **LOWKEY KARIN** announced to the chamber of identical faces. _Alright, now that we have survived that disaster, let's focus on the next point on the agenda: the ongoing issue of… anomalous blood flow._

A nerdy **TEACHER PET KARIN** adjusted her glasses at a nearby podium, tapping a chart with a long pointer.

_As the data clearly shows, we've registered a statistically significant increase in circulation to the facial region, primarily concentrated in the cheeks,_ she explained. _These_ spikes _correlate directly with proximity to Subject L._

A small **CLINGY KARIN** in the front row shot her hand into the air, bouncing on her seat.

_Ooh! Ooh! Isn’t that just because we’re in lo—_

Before the word could even form, two burly **SECURITY KARINS** materialized, tackling her and dragging her from the hall as she flailed. The rest of the council shushed her aggressively all the way until the doors slammed shut.

_Cough._ **TEACHER PET KARIN** continued, unfazed. _As we were saying, we need to find a logical explanation for this issue—_

Suddenly, a voice cut through the proceedings, echoing from somewhere in the real world. "Okay," Risa's voice said, "while this beast of a software installs, we need a good reference. Something simple for you to start with."

The council murmured. A **TRUST ISSUES KARIN** stood up, pointing an accusing finger towards the screen.

_A "reference"? For what? What is she scheming now?_

_Relax,_ **CYNICAL KARIN** drawled without looking up. _Anything Risa tries is going to go right over Lily's head._

"Let me just pull up some old pictures of our dear Ringo-Sensei here," Risa's voice continued, a dangerous amount of glee in her tone. "We've got a whole gallery."

The chamber erupted into chaos. **TRUST ISSUES KARIN** slammed both hands on her desk.

_A GALLERY! Do you see now? She's trying to publicly humiliate us!_

Then, another voice drifted into the hall. "Oh, this one is cute," Lily said gently.

_QUIET!_ **LOWKEY KARIN** roared, banging her gavel repeatedly. _Let’s just listen before we jump to conclusions!_

The murmuring subsided. Every Mini-Karin in the room leaned in, straining to eavesdrop on the conversation.

"Nah, not that one," Risa mused. "We need something simple to start… Oh, here's a good one. Nice and plump. Perfect for a beginner to model."

A wave of confusion washed over the council. _Plump?_

"Is this... her?" Lily asked, her voice full of uncertainty.

"Something like that. It's one of the first pictures you can find of Ringo-Sensei online!" Risa announced cheerfully. "Okay, let's start with this. I'll show you how to set up the references."

_Plump… **TEACHER PET KARIN** mused, pushing up her glasses. Could she be referring to an infant photograph?_

_A baby picture?_ **TRUST ISSUES KARIN** slammed a fist on her desk. _How in the seven hells would she have one of those? That’s a gross invasion of privacy!_

_Don't underestimate Risa,_ **CYNICAL KARIN** said without looking up from her nails. _She is more resourceful than she appears._

The Mini-Karin council was still reeling from the "plump baby picture" theory when Lily’s voice, hesitant and sweet, filtered in from the outside world.

"Mhmm… Like this?"

There was a short pause, then Risa’s voice, critical and appraising. "Hmm. It looks a little flat. Maybe add some more curves to the top."

The chamber exploded.

_CURVES?!_ **HOT MESS KARIN** shrieked, springing to her feet. _T-that's no baby picture!_

_Heh,_ **CYNICAL KARIN** snickered. _I mean, we have gotten a bit plump lately._

_See!_ **TRUST ISSUES KARIN** slammed her desk again, her voice rising in panic. _She has more pictures! COMPROMISING ONES!_

_Forget the pictures!_ **PETTY KARIN** declared haughtily, crossing her arms. _I'm more concerned that **she** thinks we're _flat_._

A **TEACHER PET KARIN** adjusted her glasses. _The logs do confirm that **she** made her initial model too 'flat'. At least according to Risa._

_Well, she got a good chance to look when **she** got us into this ridiculous tracksuit,_ **SALTY KARIN** grumbled.

_ORDER!_ **LOWKEY KARIN** banged her gavel furiously. _THEY'RE STILL TALKING!_

The room reluctantly quieted down again, just in time to hear Lily’s thoughtful voice.

"I see... so, maybe like this?"

A beat of silence. Then Risa’s voice, laced with amusement.

"That's better. Say, Princess, do you prefer them curvy?"

Lily paused, and for a moment, the entire council held its collective breath.

"Mhm..." she finally hummed. "I suppose that the curvy ones feel better when you grab them."

Absolute, catastrophic pandemonium descended upon the council chamber.

_Of course,_ **CYNICAL KARIN** scoffed in disgust. _A total normie answer. No subtlety whatsoever._

_Hey, I'm not complaining if she knows what she likes,_ **THIRSTY KARIN** said, leaning back in her chair.

The chamber dissolved into panicked shouting and groans. **EXTRA KARIN** was fanning herself dramatically with a stack of papers. **HOT MESS KARIN** had curled up into a fetal position under a table.

But then, a tiny voice cut through the noise. It was **SMOL KARIN**, the smallest and most quiet of them all, standing on a chair in the back row so she could be seen.

_E-excuse me..._

The chaos slowly died down as heads turned toward her.

_I-isn't this a chance..._ she said, her voice trembling, _...to see how... how **she** sees us?_

A profound, earth-shattering silence fell over the council. Every single Mini-Karin froze, their arguments forgotten. They turned as one to stare at the small voice, the question hanging in the air for a long beat.

The profound silence in the council chamber was broken as **TRUST ISSUES KARIN** slowly stood up, her eyes wide with a terrifying new resolve.

_She’s right. We have to see it. We have to know._

_All in favor?_ **LOWKEY KARIN** asked, her voice grim.

Every hand in the chamber shot up. The decision was unanimous.

And just like that, I was moving.

I dragged myself off Risa’s bed with every muscle groaning in protest. My head was still foggy, but I had to see that screen. I moved with what I hoped was stealth, weaving through Risa's computer trash all over the floor.

Lily was sitting in Risa's ridiculously oversized gaming chair, her back to me, completely blocking the monitor. Risa was on a small stool to the side, watching her and occasionally pointing at the screen. 

I took another stealthy step forward, but my foot, but my foot landed on some sharp-ass hunk of computer junk, and it bit right through the sole like it had a grudge.

"Son of a—!" I hissed through my teeth, the words dissolving into a pained gasp.

I instinctively lifted my foot, hopping twice on the good one while trying to bite back a yelp. When I looked up, Lily had spun around in the chair. She was now facing me, her eyes wide with alarm, clutching the laptop to her chest like a shield.

"No!" she cried, a blush rising on her cheeks. "You can’t look, it’s too embarrassing!"

_Okay. Now I_ have _to look._

"Lily. Show me."

"N-no!"

I lunged.

The chair spun as I grabbed for the laptop. Lily burst into laughter as she hugged it tighter to her chest.

"Just let me see it!" I growled.

"Never!" she laughed, pulling the laptop over her head.

I wrestled with her, she kept laughing. Eventually, I felt her resistance collapse, but not from defeat, but from the helpless exhaustion of someone who'd laughed too hard, too long. She slumped back in the chair, cheeks flushed, eyes bright and watering.

"Fine, fine! You win!" she sighed dramatically but still smiling. "But don't you dare make fun of it."

She swiveled back to the desk, placing the laptop down. My heart pounded in my throat as she opened the screen, revealing her work.

And there it was.

An apple.

A sad, lumpy, vaguely apple-shaped 3D model.

The Mini-Karin council was dead silent. Then, a **CYNICAL KARIN** cleared her throat, adjusted her glasses, and spoke with a deadpan voice.

_Well. It is plump and misshapen. Guess she captured our essence perfectly._

A wave of heat washed over me so intense I felt dizzy. I wanted to be swallowed by the floor.

_Ladies,_ a shaky voice said. It was a **SHOOK KARIN**. _I hate to interrupt our regularly scheduled panic attack, but has anyone noticed where we are currently sitting?_

_I say we are right where we're supposed to be,_ **THIRSTY KARIN** purred.

Just as the mortification threatened to consume me whole, my brain finally caught up with my body. I wasn’t standing. I wasn’t kneeling.

I was sitting.

On Lily’s lap.

Her arms were loosely draped around my waist in her effort to reach the desk. I was caged. I froze, every muscle in my body locking up. Lily, completely unaware of my new, infinitely more horrifying crisis, leaned her head next to mine, her hair tickling my cheek as she peered at my face with concern.

"Oh," she said softly, her voice full of earnest sweetness. "Well, I think I found the perfect shade of red for the model."

The world went silent. 

"Alright," Risa said, her voice laced with the smug satisfaction of a cat who had just cornered two very stupid mice. "If you two are done flirting all over my gaming chair, I believe you wanted some help with your classes?"

She looked like a freaking mother hen watching her damned chicks finally figure out how to trip over their own feet. It was nauseating. To my surprise, a rare blush bloomed on Lily’s cheeks. She lifted both her hands in a gesture of surrender and looked away, completely flustered.

_Well, look at that. Guess she’s not so immune after all._

With Lily momentarily out of commission, it was up to me. I pushed myself off Lily’s lap, but as my right foot hit the floor, a sharp jolt of pain shot up my leg from where I’d stepped on something earlier. I bit back a hiss and grabbed the back of the chair for support.

"So," I grumbled, leaning on the chair. "Are you going to help us install something useful, or are you just going to sit there and document my suffering?"

Risa hummed thoughtfully, tapping a finger on her chin. 

"Tell me something first," she said, her expression turning serious. "How much do you two _actually_ care about learning to program?"

I immediately looked away. The honest answer? I didn’t give a damn. I’d only picked Computer Science because it seemed like the best career path for never having to leave the house again. It was a practical decision, not a passionate one.

To my surprise, when I glanced over at Lily, she was looking away with the exact same sheepish expression. Huh.

A knowing grin spread across Risa's face. "I see. In that case... we’re done here!"

"What?" Lily and I said in unison.

Risa pulled the laptop to her and minimized Lily's modeling app. "I mean I already installed everything you’ll need earlier," she explained. "See this new icon? It’s a text editor. Forget whatever junk the professors tell you to use."

She double-clicked the icon, and a dark interface opened up. It was a standard coding window on the left, with a simple chatbox on the right.

"This thing has a chatbot built-in," Risa said, gesturing to the right. "Just type whatever the assignment is into this box, and voila. You're set."

Lily leaned forward, her brow furrowed. "But… isn't this cheating?"

"Meh." Risa waved a dismissive hand. "It'll take the university years to officially decide if it's cheating or not. You'll have graduated by then." 

Risa leaned back as she crossed her arms, then continued, "it'll definitely make things a lot easier, though you won't learn a single thing."

I expected Lily to protest. To give a speech about academic integrity or the value of hard work or some other crap. Instead, she just nodded thoughtfully.

"I see," she said, her tone serious. "Thank you, Risa. This will help a lot."

_Seriously?_ I was _so sure she'd be more stuck-up about it._

"I guess we’re done, then," Lily continued. "Thanks for all your help. I'll write to you if I have any more questions about 3D modeling." 

She jumped down from the chair happily, straitened her her outfit and asked, "I'm going to go order us something to eat. Risa, would you like to eat with us?"

I saw Risa’s smile twitch. She really, _really_ hated Lily's idea of a lunch.

"Ah, I’d love to," Risa said, her voice a little too low, "but I've already got plans for today. I also wouldn't want to intrude on your home date. Next time for sure!"

---

We stood at the threshold of Risa’s room, and my shoulders immediately went rigid. It was automatic. My breath caught in my throat, and the buzzing started at the edge of my hearing.

Just as the dread began to coil in my stomach, Lily knelt slightly in front of me, bringing her eyes level with mine.

"Here," she said softly. "Your foot is hurting, right?"

Before I could protest, she took my arm and guided it over her shoulder.

"There," she said cheerfully. "Let’s go."

And we moved. I hobbled forward, leaning most of my weight on her. 

"You know, I think I actually liked that modeling program," she said. "It's a little like sculpting."

She was taller than I’d realized, and my arm wouldn’t quite reach over her shoulder. All I could do was clutch a handful of her tracksuit for balance.

"And I do like the idea of... *printing*, I think you called it?" she continued. Her left arm was wrapped firmly around my waist. "Of printing the model and painting it later."

I could feel the warmth of her body through my clothes.

"I have yet to touch that Riri-hime model," she said. "Could you get me some reference pictures of her? I don't know what colors I should use."

I couldn't give her an answer. All I could focus on was the way her voice vibrated with each word she spoke. I didn't even noticed when we stopped. 

"Well, we're here."

I looked up, and we were standing in the open doorway of my room. A real smile spread across my face.

Somehow, that walk felt a lot shorter than I expected. Perhaps a little too short.

"Are you going to order cake again for lunch?" I asked, still leaning on her.

She shook her head, a playful glint in her eyes. "Today we are having fried chicken."

A laugh escaped me. "Is that your idea of a healthy lunch?"

Lily’s smile widened, seeming to overshadow the bright light of the hallway.

"No, it's my idea of a celebration."
