Skirt touch

My arm shot out, a desperate lunge to grab the paper before her eyes could even register the words. My fingers closed around the sheet, and for a split, horrifying second, the back of my hand brushed against the soft fabric of her dress.

Lily reads a page "How to use your tonge to..."

Stop! Karin says

Lily plays with her tongue the rest of the chapter.


Idea! Karins delusional fanfics

- **The Pairing Name:** The pairing tag will change as she learns more. It can go from `Karin/Mysterious Girl` -> `Karin/Valerie Linden` -> `Karin/Lily`. The evolution of the pairing name itself becomes a subtle tracker of their relationship's progress.
    
- **The Tags:** The tags for each delusion can perfectly match the specific fantasy. A daydream about them sharing a quiet moment could be tagged `Fluff, Domestic Bliss, Hand Holding`. A nightmare scenario about her mother showing up could be tagged `Angst, Major Character Injury (to my soul), Misunderstandings`.



### Karin's Arc (The Agoraphobia Storyline)

* **The Reveal Sequence (a multi-chapter progression):**
    1.  **The Question:** Lily asks Karin and Risa why she never sees them in her lectures, leading to the "upperclassman" reveal for Risa and a vague excuse from Karin.
    2.  **The Wall:** Lily, in a playful moment, tries to drag Karin outside the dorm's front door, and Karin freezes in genuine, un-blushing terror, not just social awkwardness.
    3.  **The Favor:** Risa is unavailable, and Karin, out of desperation (e.g., needing a specific art supply or medication), has to swallow her pride and ask Lily to run an errand for her.
    4.  **The Explanation:** Lily, having pieced together the clues, has a quiet, one-on-one conversation with Risa, who explains the origin of Karin's trauma and agoraphobia.

* **The Doorbell Panic:** A short, tense scene from Karin's POV where she struggles with the simple act of opening the door for a grocery or package delivery, showing the daily reality of her anxiety.

* **The Final Exam Trip:** A major event where Karin is forced to go to campus for a final exam. She has to rely entirely on Lily for emotional support to get through the day, creating a high-stakes, vulnerable bonding experience.

### Relationship & Slice-of-Life Moments

* **The Sock on the Doorknob:** The payoff to Risa's joke. Valerie, taking Risa's words literally, shows up for her next visit and tries to hang a sock on Karin's doorknob "like she was told," leading to a fresh wave of mortification for Karin.

* **The CS Group Project:** With Risa being in a different year, a mandatory group project in their Computer Science class forces Valerie and Karin to become academic partners, making them interact in a new, more formal context.

### Major "Event" Arcs

* **The First Anime Convention:** The whole dorm group plans and executes a trip to a local anime convention. This would be a huge step for Karin and a source of wonder for Valerie. It allows for cosplay, merchandise hunting, and navigating crowds together.

### "Volume 2" / Future Ideas

* **The Trip to Japan:** A major, multi-chapter arc where the group travels to Japan. This would flip the dynamic, with Karin being the "expert" on locations she only knows from media, while Valerie navigates the reality of the trip.



Agorafobia

- **The "Safe Zone" Shrinks**: A major issue with agoraphobia is that the "safe zone" can shrink. Initially, she might have been able to visit the dorm's common room. But after a panic attack in the hallway, that area might become "unsafe," shrinking her world further until only her own room feels secure.
- **Dependency and Control**: Her life is a paradox of control. She controls her immediate environment meticulously to avoid triggers, but she is completely dependent on delivery services for food and supplies and on her friends for anything outside of that system. A late food delivery could trigger significant anxiety.
- **In-Person Private Testing**: As part of her therapy, a long-term goal might be to take a test in a private, quiet room at the accessibility office. Her therapist might work with her for weeks on this "exposure therapy," a huge milestone that would feel like climbing a mountain.
- **Cars**: A private car would be far more manageable. It's a controlled, private environment. She can control the music, the temperature, and who is inside. There's a clear and immediate way to escape—they can just drive away. A short, planned trip in Risa's car might be a realistic goal for her therapy.
- **Public Transport**: Public transport like a bus or subway would be a **nightmare scenario**. It represents a total loss of control: it's crowded, loud, and filled with strangers. The doors close, and she can't get off whenever she wants. The risk of having a panic attack there, where escape is impossible and she'd feel trapped and embarrassed, makes it something she would avoid at all costs.



Idea:

Valerie heads toward the kotatsu while Karin makes her way to the kitchen, and they cross paths in the narrow space between the kitchenette partition and the wall. The passage is so tight that only one person can comfortably pass at a time.

Instead of waiting, Valerie presses herself against the wall to make room. Karin hesitates for a moment but, trying to appear nonchalant, squeezes through the gap as quickly as she can. Once she’s past, Valerie continues on to the kotatsu.

## Lily's Secret Rehabilitation Arc (Act 2 Subplot)

This is a secret, long-term character arc for Valerie "Lily" Linden that happens in the background of Act 2, with the full reveal serving as part of the act's climax.

* **Core Goal:** After learning about Karin's agoraphobia, Lily formulates a secret, gentle plan to help her gradually expand her comfort zone. This is the ultimate expression of her "Spider Lily" persona—using her sharp, analytical mind and ability to gently manipulate situations for a loving and supportive reason.

* **Motivation:** Her primary drive is a deep, personal empathy. Having felt trapped in her own "room" of her mother's expectations, she sees a kindred spirit in Karin. Her thought process is, **"Helping Karin is also a bit like helping the Lily that could have been."**

* **Method:** She initiates a series of seemingly quirky or random activities, all of which are actually low-stakes forms of exposure therapy. Her actions always have plausible deniability.
    * **Expanding the Space:** Casually leaving Karin's door open to get her used to the hallway not being a hard barrier.
    * **Guided Exposure:** Proposing trips to other dorm rooms (Risa's, Victoria's) under the guise of a project, allowing her to guide Karin through the "unsafe" hallway.
    * **Building Social Confidence:** Suggesting activities like doing Karin's makeup, which is a way to get her comfortable with the idea of being "seen" and feeling good about her appearance.
    * **Routine and Physicality:** Initiating a shared activity like morning yoga or exercise to build routine and physical confidence.

* **The Payoff:** The full extent of her plan is revealed to Karin (and the reader) during the **Final Exams Trip**. When Lily arrives with the limousine, noise-canceling headphones, and a pre-arranged plan with the teacher, she finally explains that she's been researching and doing these "little things" all along to prepare Karin for this big step. This serves as a massive, heartwarming emotional climax.

## Act 2: Goals & Key Plot Points

**Overall Goal:** To evolve the relationship from a fragile, post-conflict partnership into a deep, resilient bond built on mutual trust and shared vulnerability. The act focuses on the theme of **"Building the Home"** together.

### Key Character Arcs
* **Valerie's Arc:** Her primary goal is to confront her art trauma and find a new, joyful path. This involves:
    1.  Confessing the true, painful reason she stopped painting to Karin.
    2.  Taking the first brave step to create art again in a low-stakes environment in the form of showing true skill and interest in digital art.
    3.  Beginning her secret "rehabilitation" project for Karin, giving her a new sense of purpose. Across this arc, Lily will be doing small, seemingly pointless things, such as leaving Karin's door open, having Karin move around (via morning stretches), dolling her up in her room, shielding her when they are around the room. 
	    1. On pair 5 of this arc, we will reveal that Lily has been studying up on how to help people with agoraphobia and she will more actively help Karin go to school to take her tests.
		    1. She prepares a limousine from her family
		    2. She brings noise cancelling headphones
		    3. She talks to the teachers so karin can take the test by herself
    4.  Finding her place as the "artist" of the found family.

* **Karin's Arc:** Her primary goal is to trust Valerie enough to let her see her deepest vulnerability and to take the first steps toward recovery. This involves:
    1.  Confessing her agoraphobia and inability to leave the dorm.
    2.  Allowing herself to be gently guided by Valerie through the "unsafe" spaces of the dorm.
    3.  Moving from a subconscious crush to a conscious realization of her romantic feelings for Valerie.
    4. However, at the same time, the seed of doubt is planted in her, Lily has many resources, her family has enough money for a limousine, fancy noise cancelling headphones and has enough social skills to get the teachers to be understanding. She is too good for her. 

### Key Plot Points
1.  **Establishing the New Normal:** The act opens by showing their new routine: comfortable hangouts, awkward "Baka Couple" study sessions where they both fail (as they are the blind teaching the blind), and the continuation of the "Yuri Lessons" as a shared joke and bonding mechanism.

2.  **The First Collaborative Project:** The **Garage Kit / 3D Printer Arc** serves as the main activity. Risa initiates the project, but it becomes a core bonding experience for the trio, requiring Risa's tech skills, Karin's lore knowledge, and Valerie's newly rediscovered painting talent.

3.  **Expanding the "Home":** They begin to venture out of Karin's room as a group, formally meeting and collaborating with the other dorm residents like **Lady Victoria**. This solidifies the "found family" theme.

4.  **Valerie shows sincere care:** Valerie shows that she has been studying and she cares enough to take the proper steps to help her with her issues about leaving the room. It is important not to reveal to the reader that Valerie is doing this until Pair 5. However, it is very important that Valerie's motivation comes from her understanding Karin having a hard time leaving her room, because she is the same. She has never had control of her own life, so she wants to help her.

5.  **The Climax: The Final Exams Trip:** This is the culmination of the entire act. Karin is forced to face her greatest fear, and she can only do it by placing her complete trust in Valerie. Valerie, in turn, reveals the full extent of her preparation and secret plan, proving the depth of her care and commitment. Successfully navigating this trip solidifies their unbreakable bond.

## Stray Ideas & Future Plot Hooks

A list of smaller scenes and ideas to be implemented in future chapters:

* **The Sock on the Doorknob:** The comedic payoff for the joke Risa made in Chapter 4. Valerie, taking it literally, can try to hang a sock on Karin's doorknob before a visit, leading to fresh chaos.
* **The "Part Two" of the Chopsticks Lesson:** The cliffhanger from Chapter 8, where Valerie teases that the next step is for them to feed each other. This can be a running joke or a scene for a future romantic moment.
* **Karin Finds the Drawing:** Much later in the story, Karin can find the secret, impulsive drawing Valerie made of her in Chapter 3. This would be a powerful, emotional discovery after their relationship is more established.
* **The "Chekhov's Gunpla":** The Gunpla model that Valerie poses and places on Karin's shelf in Chapter 7 can be referenced later as a symbol of their reconciliation and a permanent fixture in the room.


## Novel Outline: A Four-Act Structure

### Act 1: The Setup - A Fragile Connection (Chapters 1-8)
The primary goal of this act is to introduce the main characters and their core conflict. It establishes Valerie "Lily" Linden as the "Seeker" who has escaped a rigid past, and Karin "Rin" Connelly as the "Recluse" trapped by her anxiety and trauma. The act is driven by a series of comedic misunderstandings ("Yuri Lessons") that lead to a dramatic, accidental conflict. It concludes with their first true reconciliation, where Karin reveals her agoraphobia and they form a pact to help each other with their coursework, establishing a new, more honest foundation for their relationship.

### Act 2: Building Trust - A Shared Vulnerability
This act focuses on deepening their new partnership through shared projects and mutual support. The main goals are to have both girls share their core vulnerabilities for the first time—Valerie's trauma with her art and Karin's struggle with leaving the dorm. They begin collaborating on creative projects with the other dorm residents, forming a "found family." The act's climax is the Final Exams Trip, a high-stakes event where Karin must rely completely on Valerie for support to leave the dorm, cementing their emotional and physical dependence.

### Act 3: The First Storm - An External Threat
The central goal is to test the bond they've built. An external force from Valerie's old life (likely her mother or sister, prompted by her failing grades) arrives, threatening to pull her back into the world of high art. This forces Karin to confront her deepest insecurities about being "worthy" of someone from a different world. The c
I slumped against the plaster, blinking. My entire right ear was on fire, and I could still feel traces of her breath on my skin. My dazed eyes found Lily first. She was watching me with that infuriatingly clueless smile. But that wasn't even the worst part. Oh no. The true horror came when my gaze finally landed on Risa.

She was looking at me with the gentle, loving smile of a damned mother watching her daughter take her first steps. My blood ran cold. I couldn't stand it, and my gaze dropped away from her face—only to land on the hem of a skirt that was suddenly right in front of me.

My eyes traveled up slowly up to her face. Lily was standing over me, her hand outstretched. Before my brain could even process the offer, she closed the distance, her warm fingers wrapping around mine as she pulled me effortlessly to my feet.

Once I was back in my glorious not-sprawled-on-the-floor form, for some reason, she began to carefully dust off my hoodie. Eventually, she simply took my arm and steered me the few steps back to the kotatsu. A light pressure on my shoulders had me sitting on my cushion before I’d fully processed anything that had just happened.

"Risa, could you help us with our classes?" Lily asked, her tone unconcerned. "We've been trying to study, but we keep getting distracted."

"Sure, Princess," Risa replied instantly. "Bring your laptop to my room tomorrow; I'll set you up with some cool stuff."

"That would be a big help, thanks."

"It's no biggie." Risa’s grin was audible in her voice. "Though, '￼￼distracted￼￼,' eh? It's nice to see the Baka-couple getting along so well."onflict will test their reliance on each other and will conclude with a reconciliation that proves their commitment is stronger than the external pressures.

### Act 4: The Confession - An Honest Future
This final act is about resolving all remaining internal barriers and misunderstandings, allowing them to become a couple. Key events include a cozy dorm party where Karin's feelings accidentally slip out, a period of sweet, awkward tension, and an intervention by their friends that forces them together. The climax sees Karin finally overcoming her last fear after an epiphany in Valerie's room, leading to a mutual, official confession. The act also resolves Valerie's academic arc as she decides to change her major, and sets Karin on a clear path to recovery with Valerie's support.


Saved for later, lily's second time painting

### **1. Sanding / Files**

- On canvas, the surface is already “grippy” for paint, so they’re used to working directly on it.
    
- On a smooth garage kit, they might just start painting over small mold lines or bumps and not notice at first, unless the imperfections are glaring.
    
- Usually, they realize sanding is important **after seeing paint sit unevenly** or flake off in spots.

### **2. Varnishes / Sealers**

- A canvas painter may think the paint is “done” once it looks right visually.
    
- They may only notice the need for a protective coat **after handling the figure and seeing paint rub off**, or after learning from guides that resin can be delicate.
    

### **3. Thinners / Flow Medium**

- On canvas, acrylics are forgiving; paint can be applied thickly or blended with water.
    
- On a small figure, heavy paint obscures sculpted detail, and brushstrokes are more obvious.
    
- They’d likely discover thinning the paint is necessary **after struggling to cover fine details without pooling or clumping**.
