Idea! 

Skirt touch

My arm shot out, a desperate lunge to grab the paper before her eyes could even register the words. My fingers closed around the sheet, and for a split, horrifying second, the back of my hand brushed against the soft fabric of her dress.

Idea! 

Lily chewing on the pen Karin regularly chewes on

Lily reads a page "How to use your tonge to..."

Stop! Karin says

Lily plays with her tongue the rest of the chapter.


Idea! Karins delusional fanfics

- **The Pairing Name:** The pairing tag will change as she learns more. It can go from `Karin/Mysterious Girl` -> `Karin/Valerie Linden` -> `Karin/Lily`. The evolution of the pairing name itself becomes a subtle tracker of their relationship's progress.
    
- **The Tags:** The tags for each delusion can perfectly match the specific fantasy. A daydream about them sharing a quiet moment could be tagged `Fluff, Domestic Bliss, Hand Holding`. A nightmare scenario about her mother showing up could be tagged `Angst, Major Character Injury (to my soul), Misunderstandings`.



### Karin's Arc (The Agoraphobia Storyline)

* **The Reveal Sequence (a multi-chapter progression):**
    1.  **The Question:** Lily asks Karin and Risa why she never sees them in her lectures, leading to the "upperclassman" reveal for Risa and a vague excuse from Karin.
    2.  **The Wall:** Lily, in a playful moment, tries to drag Karin outside the dorm's front door, and Karin freezes in genuine, un-blushing terror, not just social awkwardness.
    3.  **The Favor:** Risa is unavailable, and Karin, out of desperation (e.g., needing a specific art supply or medication), has to swallow her pride and ask Lily to run an errand for her.
    4.  **The Explanation:** Lily, having pieced together the clues, has a quiet, one-on-one conversation with Risa, who explains the origin of Karin's trauma and agoraphobia.

* **The Doorbell Panic:** A short, tense scene from Karin's POV where she struggles with the simple act of opening the door for a grocery or package delivery, showing the daily reality of her anxiety.

* **The Final Exam Trip:** A major event where Karin is forced to go to campus for a final exam. She has to rely entirely on Lily for emotional support to get through the day, creating a high-stakes, vulnerable bonding experience.

### Relationship & Slice-of-Life Moments

* **The Sock on the Doorknob:** The payoff to Risa's joke. Valerie, taking Risa's words literally, shows up for her next visit and tries to hang a sock on Karin's doorknob "like she was told," leading to a fresh wave of mortification for Karin.

* **The CS Group Project:** With Risa being in a different year, a mandatory group project in their Computer Science class forces Valerie and Karin to become academic partners, making them interact in a new, more formal context.

### Major "Event" Arcs

* **The First Anime Convention:** The whole dorm group plans and executes a trip to a local anime convention. This would be a huge step for Karin and a source of wonder for Valerie. It allows for cosplay, merchandise hunting, and navigating crowds together.

### "Volume 2" / Future Ideas

* **The Trip to Japan:** A major, multi-chapter arc where the group travels to Japan. This would flip the dynamic, with Karin being the "expert" on locations she only knows from media, while Valerie navigates the reality of the trip.



Agorafobia

- **The "Safe Zone" Shrinks**: A major issue with agoraphobia is that the "safe zone" can shrink. Initially, she might have been able to visit the dorm's common room. But after a panic attack in the hallway, that area might become "unsafe," shrinking her world further until only her own room feels secure.
- **Dependency and Control**: Her life is a paradox of control. She controls her immediate environment meticulously to avoid triggers, but she is completely dependent on delivery services for food and supplies and on her friends for anything outside of that system. A late food delivery could trigger significant anxiety.
- **In-Person Private Testing**: As part of her therapy, a long-term goal might be to take a test in a private, quiet room at the accessibility office. Her therapist might work with her for weeks on this "exposure therapy," a huge milestone that would feel like climbing a mountain.
- **Cars**: A private car would be far more manageable. It's a controlled, private environment. She can control the music, the temperature, and who is inside. There's a clear and immediate way to escape—they can just drive away. A short, planned trip in Risa's car might be a realistic goal for her therapy.
- **Public Transport**: Public transport like a bus or subway would be a **nightmare scenario**. It represents a total loss of control: it's crowded, loud, and filled with strangers. The doors close, and she can't get off whenever she wants. The risk of having a panic attack there, where escape is impossible and she'd feel trapped and embarrassed, makes it something she would avoid at all costs.



Idea:

Valerie heads toward the kotatsu while Karin makes her way to the kitchen, and they cross paths in the narrow space between the kitchenette partition and the wall. The passage is so tight that only one person can comfortably pass at a time.

Instead of waiting, Valerie presses herself against the wall to make room. Karin hesitates for a moment but, trying to appear nonchalant, squeezes through the gap as quickly as she can. Once she’s past, Valerie continues on to the kotatsu.
