I thought she’d show up with a watercolor set, paint a few cheerful strokes, we’d clap, and that would be it. I definitely didn’t expect her to haul an entire freaking art studio into my room.

Watching Lily work was like watching a priestess perform some kind of ritual. Her back was straight, her eyes locked on the plastic with so much focus it looked like she might melt it. And of course, they were still unfairly pretty. Because of course they were.

Her slender fingers held the brush with a delicate grip. Each stroke was followed by the same fluid routine: lift the brush, dip it into a cup of water, dab it on a cloth, then pick up the next color. Every motion was so smooth, so controlled, and so precise it was almost unnerving.

“Whoa… Princess,” Risa breathed, leaning in a little too close to her. “You’re incredible! It already looks so much better!”

*Better* was a criminal understatement. For us, *better* was when we managed to sand a piece without accidentally snapping off a fin. Whatever magic Lily was performing had transformed the cheap plastic into something that looked like actual steel. It was alchemy, and she was a goddamn witch.

“Thank you,” she said. A polite smile touched Lily’s lips, but she didn’t look up.

But that smile felt wrong. It wasn't the infuriatingly clueless smile she usually wore. This one felt almost brittle.

“By the way,” she said in a casual tone. “I've been meaning to ask. You two are in computer science, are you not? How come I never see you in any of my lectures?”

Wait. Did she just completely, totally, and utterly change the subject? 

“Yup. We're both CS students,” Risa answered. “But I'm a third-year, so my classes are mostly at night. Which reminds me,” she added, as she started throwing the empty plastic frames into a trash bag, “I probably need to get going soon.”

Lily's eyes followed Risa's hands. “I thought you were a freshman, like me.”

Risa paused her cleanup. “I get that a lot,” she said as a wicked grin spread across her face. She leaned towards Lily and dropped her voice to a conspiratorial whisper that was still loud enough for the whole damn dorm to hear.

“But don't worry! The gods of narrative made sure _Sensei_ here was a freshman, just for you.”

Lily's face lit up as she turned to me. “Oh, that's great! Then you can help me with my coursework, right?”

What?! Of course not, I'm already struggling myself. 

“… Sure.” I mumbled, defeated once again by those puppy-dog eyes.

Risa’s grin widened. “Ah, *coursework*. A classic for the first act.” She punctuated this utterly nonsensical statement by giving me a slow-motion wink.  

_Relax, Karin. Don’t give her what she wants. She feeds on your suffering, like a damned vampire._

I scoffed at her. 

“Well, my work here is done,” she shrugged, looking far too pleased with herself. “Princess, you’re in charge of the decals! I have no idea if those go on over or under the paint, so… have fun with that!”  

Having hit her daily emotional damage quota, she slid the door open and just… _peaced out_. Hand sign and everything. 

I sighed.

We stayed in silence for a while. My overworked brain cell was still trying to process the last five minutes of my life when Lily’s voice broke it.

“So… about that combat scene.”

Huh. I figured she was done with the model kit. “What about it?”

“Could you tell me more?” she asked, turning those annoyingly earnest puppy-dog eyes on me. “It's… for the details…”

“Oh. Uh, right.” I leaned forward, getting drawn in despite myself. “So the protagonist grabs this suit. It's a brand-new model, so it hasn't even been fine-tuned for him yet.”

Lily nodded twice, prompting me to continue. She actually looked interested.

“But he has no time to prep because the base is under attack. They're on this remote island, right? So there's nothing but sand outside the base.” I found myself getting a little animated as I talked.

To my surprise, she didn't just nod along. She started asking some smart questions. “What time of day is it? Is the sun high, or is it setting? That will affect the shadows.”

“Uh, late afternoon,” I said, caught off guard. “The sun's low.”

“And the sand? Is it wet, packed down by the tide, or is it dry and loose?”

“Dry. Super loose. That's the whole point of the scene,” I explained, getting excited. “The pilot's fighting the terrain as much as the enemy. He has to recalibrate the leg actuators on the fly, or the suit will lose its footing.”

“So it would be kicking up a lot of dust and sand as it moves?”

“Exactly!”

A thoughtful smile played on her lips. “I see. And what is the pose you wanted? For the diorama?”

“Oh, right.” The pose. “It's the moment right after the recalibration. An enemy beam shot hits the sand right in front of it, and the blast shoves it back, but the new settings hold. So it's like…”

Without thinking, I shot up from my chair. I planted my feet on the floor, raised my right arm as if holding a massive shield, and bent my right knee, extending my left leg back for balance.

“…like this!” I said, my voice now full of betraying passion. “It digs in and holds its ground. A real 'I'm not backing down' moment.”

I glanced over at Lily. She was cracking up, and for once it didn't feel like I was the punchline. Just a real laugh, not Risa's trademark “I'm about to ruin your life” smirk or some normie feeling sorry for the weird girl. A real, honest-to-god laugh.

And just like that, I felt like an overexcited toddler.

My face instantly caught fire. I dropped the pose and scrambled back to my chair, spinning around to face my monitor so she couldn't see the mortifying blush consuming my entire self. “Anyway! I'll let you work now.”

About an hour later, I was still sitting there, staring at a blank page like an idiot. My draft glared back at me, the cursor blinking in judgment, but the words just wouldn’t come. Every time I tried to focus, my brain wandered back to the girl across the room.  

Giving up, I pushed back from my desk and flopped over to the kotatsu, dropping onto the cushion like a sack of potatoes. Lily didn’t even glance my way; she was completely locked in. Her brow was scrunched up, and she was gnawing on her bottom lip. Every few seconds her face would shift: doubt, determination, frustration, then back to doubt again. Girl was speedrunning an entire character arc in there.  

She poked the brush over the model’s legs in quick, rough jabs, and somehow she really made it look like sand. It looked so real it reminded me of actual beach sand and how it gets into everything and then haunts you for weeks no matter how much you try to shake it off.

“You’re… really good at this,” I said, the words slipping out before I could stop them.  

Lily’s hand stilled. A faint pink blush swept her cheeks as she looked down at her work, suddenly shy. “It’s nothing special.”  

There it was again. That weird reaction. This perfect, goddess-tier normie… was she actually *bad* with compliments?  

“No, really,” I pressed. “I’ve never seen anyone handle a brush that steadily.”  

The blush on her cheeks deepened into a proper flush. She set the brush down, her composure clearly rattled. “You’re too kind,” she mumbled. “I’m making a ton of mistakes.”  

Bingo. She’s genuinely, cripplingly weak to praise about her art. This was her weakness. My brain was already spinning scenarios like a slot machine.

### The Ice Queen's Secret Garden
>
**Pairings:** Karin/Lily
**Tags:** Yuri, Teasing, Academy Setting, Villainess, Tsundere, Fluff, Embarrassment Kink (but wholesome)
**Summary:** Lady Valerie secretly practices the delicate art of flower arranging, and she can't take a compliment to save her life!
>
_“This arrangement… it’s the most beautiful I’ve ever seen,” Transfer Student Karin said, her voice full of awe._
>
_Unexpectedly, the fearsome Villainess Valerie’s face erupted in a furious blush. “Nonsense. Its composition is flawed, the petals are asymmetrical, and the vase is crooked! What would a commoner like you know of true beauty!”
>
_“But the way you arranged the lilies… it brings out their inner light,” Transfer Student Karin pressed on, stepping closer._
>
_“S-Silence!” the villainess stammered, taking a step back and hiding her face behind her fan. “Do not speak of such trivial matters!” With a mortified glare, she turned and fled the room, leaving the commoner victorious for the first time…_

I snapped back to reality. A rare wicked grin spread across my face. Ever since she first stepped into this room, this girl had been the agent of my constant suffering. But now… now I had a weapon.  

Oh, this was going to be fun. It was time for Ringo-sensei to teach her a new lesson.  

“Alright, Lily,” I said, leaning forward and resting my chin on my hands as I tried to channel my best Sensei persona. “It’s time for Yuri Lesson Number Two: The Tsundere.”  

She blinked at me, her expression a blank slate of polite confusion. “The… what?”  

“The Tsundere,” I explained. “A core character archetype. It has two phases. First, the *tsun*: sharp, prickly, and in full denial. Then, the *dere*: soft, sweet, and totally overflowing with affection. Master this, and you’ll understand half the yuri manga in existence. Maybe three-quarters, depending on how much trash you read.”  

“That… doesn’t make much sense, actually,” she said, tilting her head.  

“Exactly! Which is why we need a practical demonstration. Let’s give it a try.” I pointed at the model with the tip of my pencil. “The way you shaded that metal piece? It’s stunning.”  

Lily shook her head, her gaze dropping to the table. “It’s just a basic color trick…”  

I snapped my fingers, grinning. “Yes! Perfect *tsun* response. See? You’re a natural at this, Lily.” This was too easy.  

“I wasn’t—” Her voice caught. “I wasn’t trying to—”  

I leaned closer, with a dumb grin on my face. This was my payback for all the teasing, and it was glorious. “Seriously, the way you paint? It's stupidly good. Every line is steady, every little dab is ridiculously clean. That's real talent.”

She stiffened, turning her head away slightly. “It’s not… it’s not even that good.”  

Oh, she was made for this. The blush in her cheeks was a perfect touch. As her teacher, I couldn't be more proud.

“That’s a decent line,” I coached, “but a classic like, ‘It’s not like I painted this for you or anything, idiot!’ would’ve had more impact. Just a tip for next time.”  

“I… I’m not…” Her voice was barely a whisper. Her chest was starting to heave, her breaths coming faster and faster.  

Okay, maybe that was enough for one lesson. She looked a little overwhelmed.  

“Jokes aside, you’re the real deal, Lily,” I said, softening my tone. Maybe she genuinely needed to hear this. “You're a real artist.”

I expected a cute, flustered *dere* moment. A shy smile. Maybe even a mumbled “thank you.”  

Instead, her expression completely shattered.  

Her eyes snapped up to meet my gaze. They were brimming with tears. Her lips trembled.  

Her voice, when it came out, was loud and raw. “No! It’s not good!” she choked out with a painful edge. “I’m *not* good enough!”  

She stumbled back from the table, knocking over the cup of cloudy brush water.  

With a gut-wrenching sob, she bolted for the door, wrenched it open, and slammed it shut.

_Karin you idiot. You absolute idiot._

I was moving before I even thought, stumbling over a cushion, my heart pounding in my throat. 

_Run. You need to apologize. Now._

I reached the door and yanked it open, ready to sprint down the hall.

And froze.

Right at the threshold, my feet were suddenly bolted to the floor.

_Move, Karin. Just one step._

But my feet wouldn't respond. My heart hammered frantically against my ribs, like a trapped bird. The air in my lungs turned thick and useless. A sharp pain hit my ears when the hum of the fluorescent lights swelled into a roar.

I couldn't do it. 

The hallway outside felt impossibly vast as it distorted and tilted. And yet, it felt fragile, as if it would collapse into the void the moment I touched it. 

I couldn't do it. 

My hand, still on the doorknob, trembled violently. I just stood there, one foot in the safety of my room, the other hovering over an abyss.

I just stood there, frozen at the edge of my world.
