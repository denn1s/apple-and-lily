The grin on Risa's face was one of pure evil. Not mischievous, evil. It was the kind of smile that promised months, maybe years, of relentless teasing. My fate was sealed, and she knew it.

“Say the line,” she commanded, her voice dripping with a sadistic glee.

I knew the line. Of course, I knew the damned line. It was the most ancient, most overused, most humiliating [cliché](). At this point, getting hit by a truck would be a significant improvement to my situation.

I buried my face in my hands. My entire being recoiled, but the words were demanded by the cruel gods of comedy. Using up the last ounce remaining of my dignity, I muttered the cursed phrase into my palms.

“… It's not what it looks like.”

Risa gave me a satisfied grin, then slowly clapped as she strolled into the room. Each clap felt like a gunshot straight into my skull, making my already pounding headache even worse. My neck was killing me too. Sleeping on the floor was such a terrible idea. How did that happen again?

The girl, the cause of this disaster, had already retreated to her side of the kotatsu and was sipping her tea as if she had done nothing wrong.

I braced myself for Risa's mocking laughter. Instead, she just sat on the floor next to me. She didn't say a word. With a look of blissful peace on her face, she clasped her hands together, closed her eyes, and let out a long, serene exhale, as if she had just achieved enlightenment.

“Thank you,” she whispered, looking at the heavens with the reverence of a monk greeting the dawn. “Thank you for this precious, precious gift.”

Oh, this was so much worse than laughing. Risa was carefully archiving the moment, tagging it under 'Karin's suffering' and 'Ultimate Blackmail Material' for easy access later. My life was over. I can already picture it…

Summary: Karin and Risa enjoy a game of go while they reminisce about the past

_The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the go board. Old Woman Karin placed a stone with a strong click. Across from her, Old Woman Risa chuckled, her shoulders shaking._

_“What is it now?” Old Woman Karin grumbled._

_Old Woman Risa wiped a tear from her eye. “Sorry… I just remembered it again.” She took a wheezing breath, trying to contain her laughter. “That face you made…” After a moment, she finally managed to gasp out the words, “…‘It’s not what it looks like’…”_

_“IT’S BEEN SIXTY-THREE YEARS, YOU OLD HAG!” Old Woman Karin roared, slamming her fist on the table and scattering the stones…_

Risa completely ignored my existential crisis. Instead, she gave a good long look at the girl, and for some reason, the girl waved at her.

She answered her with a quick courtesy smile, then suddenly grabbed my shoulder and yanked me into a huddle, turning our backs to the girl. The sharp pull made my stiff neck flare with pain, and I winced.

“Okay, Sensei,” she said in a whisper that was definitely not quiet enough. “Spill it. Who is this romcom-heroine bombshell, and what exactly was _that_?”

My exhausted brain struggled to kick into gear. Think, Karin. You need a good one. 

Before I could even begin to draft a halfway decent excuse, a polite voice answered from behind us.

“I apologize. I was trying to share some of my drink with her.”

Risa and I both froze. Slowly, she turned her head back to me, but her eyes were now wide with a mischievous light. She knew the girl could hear everything.

“Okay… new question. Does she know she looks just like your ideal wai—?”

I hissed, shoving her away before she could finish the sentence.

We both whipped around to face the girl, who was watching us with a friendly smile, completely unfazed.

“I'm not sure what she means,” she said, with all the cluelessness of a harem anime protagonist. “But my name is Valerie Linden. It's a pleasure to meet you.”

Having apparently decided she was the goddamn director of this train wreck, Risa took charge.

“Okay, Valerie Linden,” Risa declared, tapping a finger to her chin. “'Valerie' is far too normal for this dorm…” She started muttering to herself, her eyes narrowed in concentration. “Vale**rie** **Lin**den… rie lin… ri-ri… Got it! From this day forward, you shall be known as **Riri-hime**! It's perfect!”

“Riri? Because of the sounds in the middle of my name? That's clever,” the girl said, tilting her head. “But… where does the 'hime' come from?”

“I'm so glad you asked!” Risa beamed, launching into a full-blown presentation. “It's from the classic magical girl anime, Magical Princess Riri! She's this super cute princess who fights the forces of despair with her Rainbow Heart Scepter! It has some surprisingly dark themes…”

Her words started blurring together as exhaustion crept up on me. She was still pitching that dumb anime like it was gospel, conveniently skipping the part where it was made for six‑year‑olds.

My head kept bobbing, drifting in and out, her voice fading into the background like static from a busted radio.

A yawn slipped out, stretching my jaw until my eyes watered. My shoulders popped as I rolled them, the tiny jolt clearing my head just enough to realize Risa was still going. 

If I didn’t say something, she’d be pitching the sequel series next. So I cut in, my voice thick with sleep: “I don’t think I could call you Riri with a straight face. How about… Lily?”

Close enough, right?

Risa immediately abandoned her anime pitch and yanked me back into a huddle. “Are you insane, _Sensei_?” she whispered frantically. “‘Lily’? That’s the most overused yuri name ever! Be more creative!”

Shit. My foggy brain finally caught up with what I'd just said.

She was right. My god, she was right. What a rookie mistake. I opened my mouth to backtrack, but it was too late…

“Oh, I love it!” We both turned. The girl was beaming, her smile so bright it made my headache spike. “I like flowers, and I especially love the deep red of spider lilies! They're my favorite.”

A shiver ran down my spine. For a split second I remembered that weird red flash I thought I saw in her eyes last night. With her talking about spider lilies now, the name suddenly felt… disturbingly appropriate.

Before I could say anything, she delivered the final blow.

“No one's ever given me a nickname before,” she said softly. “I like it.”

And just like that, my chance to protest went up in smoke. Great. Guess she's Lily now.

“Lily it is, then!” Risa clapped her hands. “Now you match with our Ringo-sensei!” She pointed at me like she was announcing the winner of a game show.

“Ringo?” Lily tilted her head.

“Yup!” Risa grinned. “It comes from Karin Connelly. Rin-co. Ringo. I gave her that nickname back in high school.”

I sighed, my voice sagging under the weight of exhaustion. Of course she’d bring that up. “Yeah. Giving people dumb nicknames is kind of her thing.”

Lily's eyes widened slightly. “So you've known each other since high school?”

“Yup,” Risa said, acting way too pleased with herself. “I've been looking after our little apple here for years.”

Lily blinked, clearly lost. She definitely didn't get the reference.

“Don't think too hard about it,” I mumbled, rubbing the back of my neck. “It's just my pen name.”

“She's a legend!” Risa started overselling me immediately. “A true master of the craft, a—”

“I still don't get the Ringo part,” Lily cut in, ignoring Risa's hype and looking straight at me. “But… how about Rin? Is it okay if I call you that?”

Rin. Huh. Didn't sound half bad, actually. “Whatever,” I grunted, looking away before my face could betray me.

“And I’m Risa!” Risa chirped, shoving herself back into the spotlight.

Finally. My chance for a tiny sliver of petty revenge. “Her real name is Clarissa,” I said, flashing Lily a smile. “But she hates it.”

“It's nice meeting you, Risa.” Lily said.

She completely ignored my perfect setup. Absolute betrayal. 

Risa shot me a look that promised retribution, then glanced between me and Lily, her eyes glinting with mischief.

“My, my. Rin and Lily,” she purred, drawing out the names. “Already on a first-name basis, are we?” She punctuated it with an exaggerated wink that made my skin crawl.

I let out a weary sigh. My eyelids felt like they weighed a ton. “Look, I'm in no mood for your games,” I grumbled. “My body hurts all over after last night—”

My mouth decided to run without any input from my sleepy brain. A cold spike of panic shot through me.

*Oh no.*

Risa’s eyes went wide. She clasped her hands to her chest, her expression a perfect imitation of a scandalized mother. 

“Oh my! I’m so proud of you, Sensei!” she gasped, dabbing at imaginary tears. “They grow up so fast…”

I wanted to just curl up and cease to exist. Preferably somewhere with a really comfortable bed.

And then Lily, bless her clueless heart, leaned forward, her face full of utterly misplaced concern.

“I’m so sorry, Rin,” she said softly. “I wouldn’t have kept going if I knew you were that tired! I feel terrible.”

My stomach dropped straight through the floor.

That was it. Risa broke. A loud, barking laugh exploded out of her, so violent she had to clutch her stomach.

I pressed my fingers into my temples, trying to physically push the conversation out of my skull. “My head already hurts,” I groaned. “Please don’t make it worse.”

“Oh, a headache?” Lily’s eyes lit up. “I know something that always helps.”

My blood ran cold. Slowly, very slowly, I turned my head toward Risa.

She was gone. Her face was red, tears streaming down her cheeks, and she was laughing so hard she couldn’t even breathe. Just wheezing.

And then Lily delivered the final blow, with the unblemished sincerity of a saint.

“Come to my room tonight,” she offered brightly. “I’ll give you a good shoulder massage.”

“Just… stop…” I mumbled into my hands.

I could feel myself sink lower and lower, trying to make myself smaller and smaller, until the last pathetic scrap of my ego finally gave up and collapsed into a freaking singularity. And of course, because the universe hates me, that singularity immediately tore a hole in reality and turned into a black hole of pure shame.

Every nerve in my body screamed as I felt myself sinking. My fingers twitched uselessly as I tried to claw my way back from the gravity of my own mortification… but it was hopeless.

Risa’s hysterical laughter was the only sound. She was wheezing and pounding the floor like she’d just witnessed the funniest thing in human history.

It took her a whole damn minute to recover enough to crawl over to where we were sitting, gasping like she'd run a goddamn marathon.

“Okay, that’s it,” she finally managed between ragged breaths, her voice hoarse from laughing. “I already love this girl. Karin, can we keep her? Please?”

I didn't even have the strength to answer Risa. The exhaustion hit me like a truck. I just dragged myself forward and collapsed face-first onto the table, my cheek pressed against the cool wood. My body gave up, my brain gave up, and I just… gave up.

Then I sank past the event horizon, drifting into the cold, merciful void of sleep.

*Rest in peace, Karin. May the void finally grant you mercy, because no one else ever did.*

---

The sound of cups clinking pulled me out of the dark. I blinked and turned my head.

Behind the counter, Lily stood with her back to me.

“You’re awake,” she said without turning.

I rubbed my eyes, still half-dreaming, and let my gaze drift to the window. The sky outside was a soft orange.

“Where do you keep the tea?” Lily asked.

“Bottom cabinet… on the right,” I mumbled, trying to hold back a yawn.

She crouched, found the box, and pulled out two bags. She poured water she had apparently already heated from the kettle into the same mismatched cups we’d used last night, then carried them over along with a plastic bag.

Sliding one of the cups toward me, she said, “I ordered us some fried chicken.”

I stared at the bag; my brain was still wading through syrup.

When I looked back, Lily was already seated, quietly sipping her tea with one hand while holding *First Blossom* in the other. 

She was almost at the end of the volume.

“Where’s Risa?” I asked, slowly recalling the events of the day.

It took her a moment to answer. She blinked, startled. “Oh, right. She said something like, ‘Please look after my daughter,’ and left.”

*And why haven’t you left?*

I wanted to ask, but Lily was already back to her tea and her book.

*Oh well. Whatever.*

I lifted the cup to my lips and took a sip. The tea was warm, but it didn’t help me wake up from the dream.
