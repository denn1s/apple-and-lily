Risa stood in the doorway, silhouetted against the morning light like some kind of harbinger of doom. The grin on her face was a masterpiece of unadulterated evil. It was the kind of smile that promised months, if not years, of relentless teasing. Her grin widened into something truly demonic.

"Say the line," she commanded, her voice dripping with sadistic glee.

 I knew the line. Of course, I knew the line. It was the most ancient, most overused, most humiliating cliché in the entire multiverse. At this point, getting hit by a truck would be a significant improvement to my current situation.

I buried my face in my hands. My entire being recoiled, but the words were demanded by the cruel gods of comedy. With the last ounce of my dignity, I muttered the cursed phrase into my palms.

"...It's not what it looks like."

The sound of a slow clap echoed in the room. Risa slowly walked in, even her steps somehow sounded satisfied satisfied. The girl had already retreated to her side of the kotatsu and was sipping her tea as if she had done wrong. 

I braced myself for the laughter. Instead, she just sank to the floor next to me. She didn't say a word. She just sat there, a look of absolute, blissful peace on her face. She clasped her hands together, closed her eyes, and let out a long, serene exhale, as if she had just achieved enlightenment.

"Thank you," she whispered with the reverence of a monk greeting the dawn. "Thank you for this precious, precious gift."

Oh, this was so much worse than laughing. This was her savoring it. Archiving it. Storing it away in her vast mental library of blackmail material to be deployed for maximum emotional damage at a later date. My life was over. I can already picture it...


### _Sixty Years Later_

_The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the go board. Old Woman Karin, her face an outline of wrinkles, placed a stone with a decisive click. Across from her, Old Woman Risa chuckled, her shoulders shaking._

_“What is it now?” Old Woman Karin grumbled._

_Risa wiped a tear from her eye. “Sorry… I just remembered it again.” She took a wheezing breath, trying to contain her laughter. “That face you made…” She finally managed to gasp out the words, “...‘It’s not what it looks like’...”_

_“IT’S BEEN SIXTY-THREE YEARS!” Old Woman Karin roared, slamming her fist on the table and scattering the stones..._


Risa completely ignored my existential crisis. Instead, she gave a good long look a the girl. For some reason, the girl waved at her. 

She dramatically grabbed my shoulder and pulled me into a huddle, turning our backs to the girl.

"Okay, _Sensei_," she said in a whisper that was definitely not quiet enough. "Spill it. Who is this romcom-heroine bombshell, and what exactly was _that_?"

Before my brain could even begin to formulate a lie, a polite voice answered from behind us.

"I apologize. I was trying to share some of my drink with her."

Risa and I both froze. Slowly, she turned her head back to me, her eyes wide with a new, even more mischievous light. She knew the girl could hear everything. 

"Okay... new question. Does she know she looks like your ideal waif—?"

I hissed, shoving her away before she could finish the sentence.

We both whipped around to face the girl, who was watching us with a friendly smile, completely unfazed.

"I'm not sure what she means," she said, with the serene cluelessness of a harem anime protagonist. "But my name is Valerie Linden. It's a pleasure to meet you."
