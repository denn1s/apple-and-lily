Risa stood in the doorway, silhouetted against the morning light like some kind of harbinger of doom. The grin on her face was a masterpiece of unadulterated evil. It was the kind of smile that promised months, if not years, of relentless teasing. Her grin widened into something truly demonic.

"Say the line," she commanded, her voice dripping with sadistic glee.

I knew the line. Of course, I knew the line. It was the most ancient, most overused, most humiliating cliché in the entire multiverse. At this point, getting hit by a truck would be a significant improvement to my current situation.

I buried my face in my hands. My entire being recoiled, but the words were demanded by the cruel gods of comedy. With the last ounce of my dignity, I muttered the cursed phrase into my palms.

"...It's not what it looks like."

The sound of a slow clap echoed in the room, each clap a new nail in my social coffin. Risa slowly walked in, even her steps sounded smug. The girl, the cause of all this, had already retreated to her side of the kotatsu and was sipping her tea as if nothing was wrong.

I braced myself for the laughter. Instead, she just sank to the floor next to me. She didn't say a word. She just sat there, a look of absolute, blissful peace on her face. She clasped her hands together, closed her eyes, and let out a long, serene exhale, as if she had just achieved enlightenment.

"Thank you," she whispered with the reverence of a monk greeting the dawn. "Thank you for this precious, precious gift."

Oh, this was so much worse than laughing. This wasn't just teasing; this was her carefully archiving the moment, tagging it under 'Karin's suffering' and 'Ultimate Blackmail Material' for easy access later. My life was over. I can already picture it...

Summary: Karin and Risa enjoy a game of go while they reminisce about the past

_The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the go board. Old Woman Karin, her face an outline of wrinkles, placed a stone with a decisive click. Across from her, Old Woman Risa chuckled, her shoulders shaking._

_“What is it now?” Old Woman Karin grumbled._

_Risa wiped a tear from her eye. “Sorry… I just remembered it again.” She took a wheezing breath, trying to contain her laughter. “That face you made…” She finally managed to gasp out the words, “...‘It’s not what it looks like’...”_

_“IT’S BEEN SIXTY-THREE YEARS YOU OLD HAG!” Old Woman Karin roared, slamming her fist on the table and scattering the stones..._


Risa completely ignored my existential crisis. Instead, she gave a good long look a the girl. For some reason, the girl waved at her.

She dramatically grabbed my shoulder and pulled me into a huddle, turning our backs to the girl.

"Okay, _Sensei_," she said in a whisper that was definitely not quiet enough. "Spill it. Who is this romcom-heroine bombshell, and what exactly was _that_?"

Before my brain could even begin to formulate a lie, a polite voice answered from behind us.

"I apologize. I was trying to share some of my drink with her."

Risa and I both froze. Slowly, she turned her head back to me, her eyes wide with a new, even more mischievous light. She knew the girl could hear everything.

"Okay... new question. Does she know she looks like your ideal waif—?"

I hissed, shoving her away before she could finish the sentence.

We both whipped around to face the girl, who was watching us with a friendly smile, completely unfazed.

"I'm not sure what she means," she said, with the serene cluelessness of a harem anime protagonist. "But my name is Valerie Linden. It's a pleasure to meet you."

Risa, having decided she was now the master of ceremonies for this disaster, took charge.

"Okay, Valerie Linden," Risa declared, tapping a finger to her chin. "'Valerie' is way too normal for this dorm. We need something better." She started muttering to herself, her eyes narrowed in concentration. "Vale**rie** **Lin**den... rie lin... ri-ri... Got it! From this day forward, you shall be known as **Riri-hime**! It's perfect!"

"Riri? Because of the sounds in the middle of my name? That's clever," she conceded. Risa loved giving nicknames to people. "But... where does the 'hime' come from?"

"I'm so glad you asked!" Risa beamed, launching into a full-blown presentation. "It's from the classic magical girl anime, _Magical Princess Riri_! She's this super cute princess who fights the forces of despair with her Rainbow Heart Scepter!" Risa was really selling it, conveniently leaving out the fact that the show was aimed at six-year-olds. "It has surprisingly dark themes, though! It can get very deep..."

I could feel my soul trying to crawl out of my body from second-hand embarrassment. I had to make it stop.

"I don't think I could call you Riri with a straight face," I blurted out. "How about... Lily?"

It was close enough, right?

Risa immediately abandoned her anime pitch and yanked me back into a huddle. "Are you insane, _Sensei_?" she whispered frantically. "'Lily'? That is literally the most generic, overused name for a main character in the history of yuri! If you're trying to cast her as the heroine, you have to be more creative than that!"

My eyes widened at the realization.

She was right. My god, she was right. That was a rookie mistake. I opened my mouth to backtrack, but it was too late.

"Oh, I love Lily!"

We both turned. Valerie was beaming at us, her smile bright full of innocense. "I like flowers, and I especially love the deep red color of Spider Lilies! They're my favorite."

A shiver went down my spine. The red flash I’d seen in her eyes yesterday. The name suddenly felt... disturbingly appropriate. Before I could process that thought, she delivered the final blow.

"No one's ever given me a nickname before," she said quietly. "I like it."

And just like that, my chance to protest was vaporized. Looks like she's Lily now.

"Lily it is, then!" Risa clapped her hands. "Now you match with our Ringo-sensei!" She pointed at me dramatically.

Lily looked at Risa, then at me. "Ringo?"

"Yup!" Risa said proudly. "Our little apple teacher."

Lily’s expression was one utter confusion. She clearly didn't get neither the 'apple' or the 'teacher' part.

"Don't think too much about it," I mumbled. "It's just my pen name."

"She's a legend!" Risa started to oversell it. "A true master of the craft, a—"

"I still don't get the Ringo part," Lily said, cutting through Risa's hype and speaking directly to me. "But... how about Rin? Is it okay if I call you that?"

Rin. It didn't sound so bad, actually. "Suit yourself," I grunted, looking away, almost on reflex.

"And I'm Risa!" Risa chirped, inserting herself back into the conversation.

I saw my chance for a tiny sliver of revenge. "Her real name is Clarissa," I said, looking at Lily. "But she hates it."
