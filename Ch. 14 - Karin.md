_Shit, did she notice?_

My heart was trying to hammer its way out of my ribcage. I’d managed to keep a straight face through this whole ridiculous “makeup lesson,” but that last part… that was a fatal mistake. 

My gaze dropped down to my index finger.

It still felt warm. The impossible softness of her lips was practically seared into my skin.

That was way too close.

Why did she have to be so stupidly gorgeous?

I risked a glance at her. Lily had turned her head away and didn't really seem fazed. 

_She didn't notice._

Relief crashed through me so hard my shoulders actually dropped.

I capped the lipstick and set it down on the bed, then released a long breath. My lungs slowly remembered how to work. My pulse started to slow, and the tightness in my chest loosened.

_Okay. You survived. Just end the lesson, go back to your desk, and—_

“Alright.”

My entire body locked up. Lily's voice cut through my five seconds of calm like a blade.

“Now it's your turn.” She finished with a wicked grin.

My breathing stopped for what had to be the fourth time that day. I swallowed hard against a suddenly dry throat.

This wasn't a lesson. It was a goddamn trap.

---

The makeup supplies were still spread across the bed like tools laid out for an interrogation. Foundation. Powder. That tiny brush. The lipstick.

Instruments of torture, every single one.

I sat on the edge of the mattress where she'd been moments ago, hands gripping my knees. Lily stood before me, examining each one like an inquisitor deciding where to start.

My eyes flicked down. To her shirt. To the buttons—

_Don't look. Don't you dare look._

Lily picked up the eyeshadow brush, and it came straight for my face like a knife.

I squeezed my eyes shut.

_This is what you get for having impure thoughts, Karin._

The bristles touched my eyelid.

And…

Just a soft sweep of the brush. Gentle. Almost nice, actually. Lily's other hand came up to steady my face, placing her fingers against my forehead with some light pressure.

_What the hell?_

She was just… painting.

The brush lifted, then returned. Smooth, confident strokes.

I cracked one eye open. Lily's face was inches from mine, but she wasn't looking at me. Not really. Her expression was focused, intent. No hesitation. No trembling hands. She examined my face the way she'd studied those model pieces.

When was the last time I'd seen her face without that dumb, clueless smile?

The foundation came next. She squeezed a bit onto her fingertips, then caught my jaw to keep me still.

This must be the real Valerie.

Cool dots landed on my face. Forehead. Cheeks. Chin. Then her fingers started moving, tracing slow circles that spread the cool paste across my skin. 

This girl had skill. Real, undeniable skill. The kind that didn't just appear. The kind that took years of practice.

And still, one kind word would undo her. One little compliment and she would crumble.

_Who hurt you?_

What made you give up however many years of practice it must have taken to get this good?

She set down the foundation and picked up the powder compact. The large brush swept over my cheeks, my forehead, and down the bridge of my nose. Soft but confident. Each stroke added another layer to her painting. Her focus never wavered.

Was it in high school? It only took a few words from a group of assholes to make me lock my own door. I wonder what they did to make you put down your brushes.

Lily drew back, studied my face, then came right back in. A bit more here, a tiny fix there. Always one more detail.

Her hand stilled. She reached for the lipstick. The one I'd just used on her. The soft click of the cap made my pulse jump.

“Don't move,” she whispered.

Her left hand found my chin, fingers warm against my skin. The lipstick touched my lower lip. It felt cool.

Her hand moved with absolute confidence, tracing the curve of my mouth in one smooth motion. No hesitation. No trembling. I held perfectly still, barely breathing.

If she felt even a hint of air against her fingers, she'd know how nervous I was.

Skillfully, she painted my lips once again, making small adjustments here and there, until she finally pulled back to check her work. Her eyes scanned my face with that same focused expression.

“There.” She said it softly, almost to herself. “Perfect.”

Then she stepped back.

Her shoulders dropped. The furrow in her brow smoothed out. That familiar, dumb smile started creeping back onto her face.

I still didn't dare breathe.

---

Sigh. Why did I even agree to find a mirror?

I really needed to build up some kind of resistance to those puppy-dog eyes.

I was on my hands and knees, rummaging through the clutter under the bathroom sink. My fingers brushed past old cleaning supplies and a forgotten roll of toilet paper. It had to be here somewhere. I was sure I'd shoved it back here when I first moved in.

When was the last time I'd even looked in a mirror? Probably one of those annoying apps that insists you turn on the camera instead of just using a damn password. Even then, I'd usually just aim it at my face without actually looking.

I reached into the very back of the cabinet until my fingers finally brushed against fabric.

There.

I pulled it out carefully. Dust clung to the faded blue towel wrapped around it. I'd shoved this back here when I first moved in… what, six months ago? Had it really been that long?

Please don't be broken.

I wiped the surface with the towel. The Grand Sage liked to play the kind, all-knowing dorm mother, but I knew better. If anything here broke, she'd make sure it came out of my wallet.

I stared at the mirror in my hands.

What was even the point? It was just going to be the same tired face as always. No amount of makeup could change that.

But… Lily had spent all that time. She'd been so careful with every detail.

The least I could do was look.

I drew in a breath and lifted the mirror.

My eyes stayed shut for another second. Then I opened them.

For a moment, I just stared. My whole body went still.

Who…?

I leaned closer to the sink, angling the mirror toward the light.

Is this really… me?

My eyes looked better somehow. Less tired. The dark circles were gone, or at least hidden. My skin didn't have that dull, washed-out look. And my mouth… it actually had shape to it. Color. 

I tilted the mirror slightly. Testing.

Huh.

Not… bad.

Actually… not bad at all.

Lily had even fixed my hair at some point. Twisted it into a bun that looked intentional instead of the usual tangled mess I just shoved a pencil into.

I kept staring.

Maybe if I'd put this much effort into my appearance back then—

My grip tightened on the mirror. Faces from high school flashed through my head. The whispers. The laughter.

No.

I sat up straighter, forcing the memory down. I didn't give a damn what a bunch of shallow snobs thought back then. Never did. That wasn't even why it hurt.

And it doesn't matter now anyway.

Lily really was some kind of magician. She'd made even me look halfway decent. It hadn't even taken that long.

Maybe… if she helped me again…

I could try leaving the dorm. Feel the sun on my skin again. Just once.

My smile faded.

If only it were that easy.

It wasn't just about appearance. I knew that. But still… for a second there, I'd actually hoped it could be.

I glanced back at the mirror one more time.

The girl looking back at me was smiling again.

---

I stepped out of the bathroom still processing how I'd just spent the last ten minutes smiling at my own reflection like an idiot.

The good mood lasted about three seconds.

My eyes found the desk… and the warmth in my chest flash‑froze.

Lily was leaning over my keyboard, head tilted in curiosity, eyes glued to the monitor.

The monitor that was on.

The monitor that had my fanfic draft open.

*Oh no. Oh no no no.*

“Oh, you're back!” she said brightly, turning toward me. “I was just wondering—”

She never got to finish. I lunged.

My only thought was to turn off the monitor—save whatever scraps of dignity I had left.

What I hadn't accounted for was the chair.

My foot caught one of the rolling legs, sending the chair shooting sideways. I stumbled, arms flailing for balance. My right hand slapped the desk, sending loose papers exploding into the air. My left hand, desperate to stay upright, grabbed the first solid thing it could find.

Lily's arm.

She let out a surprised yelp as I pulled her off balance. For one surreal second, we were locked in a clumsy, spinning dance of doom. Surrounded by a blizzard of fluttering paper. 

I could see her laughing.

We switched positions somehow. Her arm went around my shoulders. My hand braced against something soft.

Then gravity won.

We went down in a tangled heap. I hit a cushion hard enough to knock the wind out of me. It didn't hurt, but everything went dark.

Where—what—?

Weight pressed down on me. Warmth. The rustle of clothing and a breathy laugh right above me. Lily shifted, sitting up slowly, and the darkness lifted as she moved off my face.

She was sitting on my thighs.

I blinked up at the ceiling, my brain lagging several seconds behind reality.

For half a heartbeat I thought she might be hurt, but then she tilted her head back and laughed.

“This is just like when we first met, isn't it?” she said, sounding way too pleased for someone who'd just been body-slammed.

That stupidly beautiful smile—wait, no, can't focus on that right now—

My eyes finally caught up with my brain and focused on her face.

And then I saw it.

Oh no.

There, on her right cheek… was a perfect, bright red print of my lips.

When the hell—how—

“But you fell by yourself that time,” Lily went on, completely oblivious. “You can be really clumsy sometimes.”

It must have happened when we fell. The lipstick she'd just put on me. My face pressed against hers in the chaos.

I didn't even notice!

“Say, did you find that mirror?” Lily asked, tilting her head, giving me a perfect view of the kiss mark. “I'd like to check how my own makeup ended up.”

She hasn't noticed yet.

If she sees it in a mirror—

“Wait!” I shot upright. She was still sitting on my thighs. My hands went to her face before my brain could catch up. “You have something on your—”

My thumb pressed against the mark and swiped hard across her cheek. Please work, please work—

The red smeared, then faded.

Oh thank god.

Crisis averted.

And then my brain caught up.

Wait.

I froze. My hands were still cupping her face. She was still sitting on my lap. Our faces were inches apart.

Her eyes were huge. Her hair caught the light in flecks of gold. Her lips were still bright red—the lipstick I'd put on her myself.

I was holding her face in my hands.

She couldn't move. I could just lean forward and—

No no no—

I released her like she was on fire and jerked my hands back in surrender. “S-Sorry—I didn't—” My voice came out strangled. “There was just… —on your cheek—”

I let my hands drop to my lap, breathing hard. My palms still tingled with the warmth of her skin… but there was something more. Foundation. My hands were covered in smeared foundation.

I risked a glance at her face.

And my brain short-circuited all over again.

Where I'd wiped away the lipstick mark, the thick layer of makeup was gone too. And underneath—

Pink. A real, honest-to-god blush spreading across her cheeks.

She turned her head away, bringing a hand up to tuck some hair behind her ear. Hiding her face.

“I-It's alright…” Her voice came out uncertain. Shaky.

Wait.

Is she—flustered?

Like, actually flustered?

The goddess. The predator. The infuriatingly perfect girl who'd been teasing me nonstop for weeks—

Was blushing.

She was nervous.

I made her nervous.

---

The silence hung between us. A minute, maybe. Or just a few seconds that felt longer.

Lily moved first, pushing herself to her feet and brushing off her clothes. Not quite as graceful as usual.

“Oh, look at the time.” Her voice came out too bright, too cheerful. “I should… I'll go get us something to eat.”

She was already turning toward the door.

“Wait.”

The word came out calmer than I expected. Lily stopped, glancing back at me.

I stood up slowly, meeting her eyes.

“Let's order food today.” I took a breath. “Then… I'll go pick it up at the door.”

Her eyes widened slightly.

“Alone,” I added.

The word hung in the air between us.

If it's today… I think I can do it.

It was just a hallway. Just a door. I'd done this many times before. Lily did it every single day without thinking twice.

My hands were shaking a little, but I kept them at my sides.

“If… if that's okay.”

---

We waited in silence. I sat at the kotatsu, trying to keep my breathing even. Lily was gathering the scattered pieces of the Riri-hime model from the table.

I watched her hands as she worked. They were shaking.

Is it still from before…? Or is she worried about me?

Usually, she'd be disassembling and reassembling the parts while we waited, but today, she was just putting them straight back in the box.

The low buzz of my phone cut through the quiet.

Lily flinched. A small plastic piece slipped from her fingers and clattered to the floor.

“It's them,” I said, keeping my voice steady.

It was time.

“Will you be okay?” Lily's voice came out tight and strained.

I nodded. Didn't trust myself to say more.

I walked the few steps to my bedroom door. Each one felt heavier than the last.

The door was already open.

I hadn't even noticed. When had she—

I turned back to complain about her leaving it open again, but the words caught in my throat.

Lily was on her feet, a few steps behind me. Unsteady. Her hands were clasped together, knuckles white. The worry on her face was so raw it almost hurt to look at.

She's more nervous than I am.

Something warm spread through my chest.

I turned back to the threshold without saying anything.

Time to do this.

I braced myself. I mustered every bit of determination I had. Ready for the buzzing sound, the twisting walls, the panic that would try to drag me under.

It will be fine. If it's today, it will be fine.

I took a breath and stepped out.

My body tensed, waiting for the shock.

And then…

Nothing.

I stood there, one foot in the hallway, waiting for my lungs to seize. For the world to tilt. For the roaring in my ears to start.

Nothing happened.

Huh.

I took another step. Then another.

It was just a hallway. The same old boring hallway I'd seen a hundred times before. Beige walls. Fluorescent lights. That odd smell of cleaning supplies.

That's it.

I glanced back toward Risa's door at the far end. That distance that had felt impossibly vast just days ago… It didn't seem like such a big deal right now.

Huh.

I kept walking. Past Lily's door. Down toward the entrance. Each step felt… normal. Unremarkable.

My hand hesitated on the handle.

The entrance to the dorm. The door to the outside world. The one I hadn't opened in months.

*Just open it in one motion, Karin. Before the fear catches up.*

I pulled it open.

Warmth hit my skin first.

Real warmth. Sunlight. The kind that seeped into your skin. The one that made you feel alive.

Fresh air filled my lungs. Outside air that didn't taste stale or trapped. It was cool and clean.

God, I'd forgotten what this felt like.

The light was too bright, so I kept my gaze low. Focused on the concrete just beyond the threshold. The paper bag with our lunch was just sitting there.

Looking up at the distance might be too much, but this—standing here, feeling the warmth, breathing real air—this was good enough for today.

This was enough for today.

I bent down and picked up the bag. Then I turned around and walked back inside.

One step at a time.

I started walking down the hallway, still processing what had just happened. My door was open at the far end. Lily stood in the doorway, waiting.

I felt… good. Accomplished, even.

“That wasn't too bad—”

The words died in my throat.

I stopped walking.

Lily's fists were clenched so tight her knuckles had gone bone white. Her nails had dug straight through her palms. I could see thin lines of blood running down the sides of her hands.

Her shoulders were locked up. Trembling. Her eyes were fixed on me. Unblinking, like she'd been frozen there the entire time. Her breathing came in shallow, rapid bursts.

Like all my fear had been passed to her instead.

She was…

Oh.

Understanding washed over me, warm and overwhelming.

She'd been terrified.

For my sake.

The paper bag crinkled in my grip as my hands tightened around it. My throat felt tight, but my heart felt light. I knew I couldn't have done it alone. Not without her here, holding all that fear so I didn't have to. 

To be seen. To be cared for. To be worried for. So this is how that feels.
