_Shit, did she notice?_

My heart was trying to hammer its way out of my ribcage. I’d managed to keep a straight face through this whole ridiculous "makeup lesson," but that last part… that was a fatal mistake. 

My gaze dropped down to my index finger.

It still felt warm. The impossible softness of her lips was practically seared into my skin.

That was way too close.

Why did she have to be so stupidly gorgeous?

I risked a quick peek. Lily had turned her head away and didn't really seem fazed. 

_She didn't notice._

Relief crashed through me so hard my shoulders actually dropped.

I capped the lipstick and set it down on the bed, then released a long breath. Air filled my lungs again. My pulse started to slow and the tightness in my chest loosened.

_Okay. You survived. Just end the lesson, go back to your desk, and—_

“Alright.”

My entire body locked up. Lily's voice cut through my stupid, five seconds of calm like a blade. When my eyes snapped back to her, I swear I caught, just for a split second, that damned flash of red in her eyes.

“Now your turn.” She finished with a wicked grin.

My breathing stopped for what had to be the fourth time that day. I swallowed hard against a suddenly dry throat.

This wasn't a lesson. It was a trap. And I had just walked right into it.

---

The makeup supplies were still spread across the bed like a surgeon's tray. Foundation. Powder. That tiny brush. The lipstick.

Instruments of torture, every single one.

I sat on the edge of the mattress where she'd been moments ago, hands gripping my knees. Lily stood before me, studying the collection the way an executioner might appraise a lineup of shiny new blades.

My eyes flicked down. To her shirt. To the button. The one she'd undone earlier when she—

_Don't look. Don't you dare look._

But from this angle, with her leaning over me, I could see—

_Christ. You're the worst._

Lily picked up the eye shadow brush and it came straight for my face like a knife.

I squeezed my eyes shut.

_This is what you get for having impure thoughts, Karin._

The bristles touched my eyelid.

And...

Just a soft sweep of the brush. Gentle. Almost nice, actually. Lily's other hand came up to steady my face, fingers resting against my jaw with some light pressure.

_What the hell?_

She wasn't teasing me like I expected. She was just... working.

The brush lifted, then returned. Smooth strokes that barely registered as touch.

I cracked one eye open. Lily's face was inches from mine, but she wasn't looking at me. Not really. She was just examining her work like my face was a freaking half‑finished painting. Her brow furrowed slightly. Her lips pressed into a thin line of concentration.

When was the last time I'd seen her face without that dumb, clueless smile?

_No, wait. I remember. The second she picked up a brush, she changed. She became serious, focused, and completely locked in._

The foundation came next. She squeezed a bit onto her fingertips, then caught my jaw to keep me still, like I might make a break for it.

_This must be the real Valerie._

Cool dots landed on my face. Forehead. Cheeks. Somewhere near my chin. Then her fingers started to move, tracing slow circles that spread the chill across my skin. Too careful. Too gentle. Way too fancy for someone like me.

This girl had skill. Real, undeniable skill. The kind that didn't just appear. The kind that took years of practice. And still, one kind word could undo her. One little compliment and she would crumble.

_Say, who hurt you?_

_What made you give up however many years of practice it must have taken to get this good?_

She set down the foundation and picked up the powder compact. The large brush swept over my cheeks, to my forehead, down the bridge of my nose. It was soft but relentless. Each stroke adding another layer to her painting. Her focus never wavered.

_Was it in high school? It only took a few words from a group of assholes to make me lock my own door. I wonder what they did to make you put down your brushes._

Lily drew back, studied my face, then came right back in. A bit more here, a tiny fix there. Always one more detail.

Her hand stilled. She reached for the lipstick. The one I had used on her. The soft click of the cap made my pulse jump.

"Don't move," she whispered. 

Her left hand found my chin again, fingers warm against my skin. The lipstick touched my lower lip. It was cool.

Her hand moved with absolute confidence, tracing the curve of my mouth with precision. I stayed perfectly still, barely breathing. If she felt even a hint of air against her fingers, she’d know how rattled I was. She turned her wrist, fixing one more detail, while I sat there pretending to be stone.

Her eyes scanned my face one more time with an expression of pure concentration, until she finally pulled the lipstick away.

"There," she said softly, almost to herself. "Perfect."

Then she stepped back.

Her shoulders dropped slightly. The furrow in her brow smoothed out. That familiar smile started to return to her face.

I still didn’t dare to breathe.

*Sigh. Why did I even agree to find a mirror?*

I really need to gain some kind of resistance to those puppy-dog eyes.

I was on my hands and knees, rummagin g through the clutter the bathroom sink. My fingers brushed past old cleaning supplies and a forgotten roll of toilet paper. It had to be here somewhere. I was sure I’d shoved it in the back when I first moved in.

When was the last time I’d even looked in a mirror? It had to be one of those annoying apps that insists you turn on the camera instead of just using a damn password. Even then, I'd usually just aim it at my face without looking.

I knelt down, reaching into the very back of the under-sink cabinet until my fingers finally brushed against an old towel.

_There you are._

I pulled it out carefully. Dust clung to the faded blue fabric. I’d shoved it back here when I first moved in… What, six months ago? Had it really been that long?

_Please don't be broken._

I wiped the surface with the towel, clearing away the grime. The Grand Sage liked to play the kind, all‑knowing dorm mother, but I knew better. If anything here broke, she’d make sure every yen came out of my wallet.

What was even the point of checking a mirror, anyway? It was just going to be the same tired face as always; no amount of makeup could fix that. But... after all the effort Lily put in, I guessed the least I could do was take a look.

I drew in a breath, shut my eyes for a second, and lifted the mirror.

For a moment, I just stared. My whole body went still.

_Who is this?_

I leaned closer to the sink, angling the mirror toward the light.

Is this really… me?

My eyes looked sharper. My skin wasn’t as dull. My mouth wasn’t just that tired straight line. I looked different.

I looked… put together.

I tilted the mirror, testing the angle. Huh. Not… bad. Lily had even fixed my hair, twisting it into a bun that actually looked intentional instead of the usual bird’s nest.

Maybe if I’d put this much effort into my appearance back then—

My grip tightened on the mirror. Faces from high school blurred through my head: the whispers, the laughter...

No.

I sat up straighter, shoving the memory aside. I don’t give a damn what a bunch of shallow snobs thought back then. Never did. That’s not even why it hurt. And it doesn’t matter now anyway.

I looked back at the girl in the mirror. Lily really was some kind of magician; she’d made even me look halfway decent. It hadn’t even taken long.

Maybe… if she helped me again, I could try leaving the dorm.
Feel the sun again on my skin. Just once.

If only it were that easy.

It wasn't just about appearance. I knew that. But as I stared at the girl in the mirror, I realized something else.

When did she start smiling?

---

I stepped out of the bathroom still trying to process that I’d spent the last ten minutes smiling at my own reflection like an idiot.

The good mood lasted about three seconds.

My eyes found the desk... and the warmth in my chest flash‑froze.

Lily was leaning over my keyboard, head tilted in curiosity, eyes glued to the monitor.

The monitor that was on.

The monitor that had my latest fanfic draft open.

*Oh no. Oh no no no.*

“Oh, you’re back!” she said brightly, turning toward me. “I was just wondering—”

She never got to finish. I lunged.

My only thought was to turn off the monitor—save whatever scraps of dignity I had left.  
What I hadn’t accounted for was the chair.

My foot caught one of the rolling legs, sending the chair shooting sideways. I stumbled, my arms flailing for balance. My right hand slapped against the desk, sending a cascade of loose papers exploding into the air. My left hand, in a desperate attempt to stay upright, grabbed the first solid thing it could find: Lily's arm.

She let out a surprised yelp as I pulled her off-balance with me. For a surreal second, we were locked in a clumsy, spinning dance of doom. Surrounded by a blizzard of fluttering paper, I could see her laughing. 

We switched positions somehow. Her arm went around my shoulders. My hand braced against something soft.

Then gravity won.

We went down together in a tangled heap. I seemed to have landed in a cushion, so it didn't hurt, but everything went dark.

Where—what—?

Warmth pressed against me, followed by the rustle of clothing and a breathy laugh. Lily shifted, sitting up slowly, and the darkness lifted as she moved. Then right above me, her weight resting across my thighs.

I blinked at the ceiling, my brain lagging several seconds behind everything else.

For half a heartbeat I thought she might be hurt, but then she tilted her head back and laughed.

“This is just like when we first met, isn’t it?” she said, sounding entirely too pleased for someone who’d just been body‑slammed.

_What just happened? Why is she sitting on my—that stupidly beautiful smile—wait, no, can't focus on that right now—_

My eyes finally caught up with my brain and focused on her face. And then I saw it.

_Oh no._

There, on her right cheek, was a perfect, bright red print of my lips.

_When the hell—how—_

“But you fell by yourself that time,” Lily went on, completely oblivious. “You can be really clumsy sometimes.”

It must have happened when we fell.

_I didn’t even notice!_

“Say, did you find that mirror?” Lily asked, tilting her head just enough to show off the kiss‑mark. “I’d like to check how my own makeup ended up.”

*She hasn’t noticed. She’s going to see it. She’s going to look in the mirror and—*

“Wait!” I shot upright—she was still sitting on my thighs—and before my brain caught up, my hands were already on her face. “You have something on your—”

My thumbs moved on instinct, scrubbing at the spot in frantic circles. Come on, come on, come on…

The mark quickly faded, leaving only the warmth of her skin and my impending death by embarrassment.

 let out a sigh.

And then my brain caught up.

Wait.

I froze. My hands were still cupping her face.

She was still on my thighs.

Our faces were inches apart. 

Her eyes were huge, and her hair was made up of flecks of bright gold that caught on the light. Her lips were still bright red from the makeup I myself had applied. 

I was holding her.

She was trapped. I could easily just—

No no no—

My eyes squeezed shut. I released her as if she were on fire, pulling my hands back and holding them up in surrender. "Ehm… uh… S-Sorry…" I stammered, my voice shaking. 

I let my hands hover for a second, breathing hard, the echo of her warmth still clinging to my palms. Slowly, I lowered them, letting them fall into my lap.

I could see they were covered in a smear of foundation.

I risked a glance at her face.

And my brain short-circuited all over again.

The lipstick was gone, but in its place, a delicate pink was blooming across her cheeks. A real blush. 

She was looking away, and she brought a hand up to push a strand of hair behind her ear, partially hiding her face.

"I-It's alright…" she stammered, her voice suddenly small and uncertain.

_Wait. Is she—flustered? Like actually flustered?_

The goddess, the predator, the infuriatingly perfect normie… was blushing. She was nervous.

I had made her nervous.

---

The charged silence hung in the air between us for what felt like a minute, but was most likely just a couple of seconds. Lily was the first to move, pushing herself gracefully to her feet and brushing off her clothes.

"Oh, look at the time," she said, sounding a bit too bright. "I should... I'll go get us something to eat."

The lingering confidence I had felt this day, it was all still there, and I made a decision on the spot. 

"Wait," I said, calmer than I expected. Lily stopped, turning back to me.

"Let's order food today." I took a deep breath. I stood up, meeting her surprised gaze.

"Then... I'll go pick it up at the door." I let the words hang in the air for a second before adding the most important part.

"Alone."

_If it's today... I think I can do it._ 

It was fine. I’d done this hundreds of times before I came here. It's just a hallway. Just a door. Lily does that and more every day. 

---

We waited for the food in a quiet tension. I sat at the kotatsu, trying to keep my breathing even. Lily was gathering the scattered pieces of the Riri-hime model. I watched her hands as she worked. They were shaking slightly.

_Is it still from before...? Or something else?_

Usually, she’d be disassembling and reassembling the parts while we waited for food, but today, she was just putting them straight back in the box.

The low buzz of my phone on the table cut through the silence like a knife.

Lily’s hand jerked, and a small plastic piece clattered onto the floor.

"It must be them," I said, keeping my voice steady. It was time.

"W-will you be alright?" Lily's voice was tight.

I just nodded, then walked the few steps to my bedroom door. 

The door was already open. I hadn't even noticed. When had—

I turned back to complain about Lily leaving it open again, but the words died when I saw her. She was unsteady on her feet, following a few steps behind. The worry was written all over her face.

_She's more nervous than I am._

I turned back to the threshold without saying anything.

Time to do this.

I braced myself. Mustered every bit of determination I had. Got ready for the buzzing sound, the twisting walls, the panic that would try to drag me under.

_It will be fine. If it is today, it will be fine._

With another breath I stepped out.

My body was tensed hard, waiting for the shock.

And then...

Nothing.

I stood there, one foot in the hallway, waiting for my lungs to seize up. For the world to tilt. For the roaring in my ears to start.

Nothing happened. 

_Huh._

I took another tentative step. Then another.

It was just a hallway. The same old, boring, vaguely clean hallway I'd seen a hundred times before. Beige walls. Fluorescent lights. The faint smell of cleaning supplies.

That's it.

I turned slightly, looking back toward Risa's door at the far end. That distance that had felt impossibly vast just weeks ago.

It didn't seem like such a big deal right now.

_Huh._

I kept walking. Past Lily's door. Down the hallway toward the dorm entrance. Each step felt normal. Unremarkable.

My hand hesitated on the handle for only a second before I pulled it open in one motion.

_It's okay, just open it in one motion._

Warmth hit my skin first. Real warmth, not the recycled air from dorm. Fresh air filled my lungs. Actual outside air that didn't taste stale. It felt clean and cool.

The light was still too bright so I kept my gaze low, focused on the floor just outside the threshold.

Looking up at the distance might be too much, but this—standing here, feeling the warmth, breathing real air—this was good enough for today.

I bent down and picked up the paper bag of fast food sitting on the doorstep.

Then I turned around and started walking back.

_Huh._

I bean walking back down the hallway, processing what had just happened. I could see my door open at the far end with Lily waiting in the doorway.

I felt... good. Accomplished, even.

"That wasn't too bad—"

The words caught in my throat.

I stopped walking.

Lily's fists were white. Bone white. Her nails had dug straight through the skin of her palms and a sliver of blood ran down the side of her hand.

Her shoulders were locked. Trembling. Her eyes were wide, fixed on me. They looked as if she hadn't blinked for a full minute. Her breathing was shallow and rapid.

_She was..._

Understanding crashed into me.

_She was scared._

This whole time I'd been walking down that hallway, Lily had been standing here. Watching. Unable to follow. Unable to help.

Just waiting.

_She was terrified._

_For me. For my sake_

The paper bag crinkled in my grip. My throat felt tight, but my heart felt light.
