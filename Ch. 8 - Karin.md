A pair of chopsticks hovered in front of my eyes like sharp claws readied to strike.

"I don't think I'll ever figure out what's supposed to be so charming about these things if I can't even hold them right." Her deceptively sweet voice echoed in my head, bouncing off the walls and cornering me. 

I swallowed. Hard.

My eyes fell on her slender fingers, curling around the wood with unnerving grace. Then I flinched as my gaze suddenly met hers. Those terrifying red eyes.

*No Karin, this is not the timid girl from last night.*

"I think you’ll need to give me a lesson..." 

Her lips curved into a sharp smile that could cut glass.

"*Sensei*."

*No, this is a goddamn predator, and you are its damned prey.*

She lowered the chopsticks. Slowly. From my eyes… to my cheeks. From my cheeks… to my lips.

*Stay absolutely still, Karin. Their vision is based on movement.*

Her eyes, still glowing with that demonic red light, never left mine.

*\*Click\**

The chopsticks snapped shut just in front of my mouth, and I flinched. The sharp sound brought me back to myself, just enough to croak out a reply.

"Sure…" I managed, trying to put on a confident air. "A-anything you want."

I mean, what else could I say? I couldn’t shatter her image of Ringo-sensei as the cool-as-hell mentor, the all-knowing guide. That’s why she kept coming back. If I couldn’t play the part, why would she stay?

So here I was, practically volunteering for slaughter.

I took a deep breath. My only hope was to summon her: the confident, brilliant author who lived in my head. The one who ate normies like her for breakfast. She was the only one who could handle this.

I reached for the door to Ringo-sensei’s office... but it was slammed shut. A hastily scrawled sign was tacked to the front:

OUT OF OFFICE. GOOD LUCK!

There was no escape.

I was completely, utterly, royally screwed.


*Okay. Relax, Karin. Just... help her. Give her some simple pointers, a basic example. It's just chopsticks, it'll be fine. She's just a girl. No matter how terrifyingly beautiful she is.*

_Oh no._

It was too late when I realized my fatal mistake.  

*They can smell fear.*

She rose from her cushion in one fluid motion, but I didn't miss that damned demonic glint as she stood. She had just locked onto her prey.

She moved quickly, her movements betraying no sound. Not even the whisper of fabric. Not when she was hunting.

But I noticed the ripples on my instant noodle. She was getting closer.

One ripple.

My pulse hammered so hard against my ribs I was sure the entire kotatsu was shaking with it.

Two ripples.

The alarms in my head screamed louder with each step. _Why is she coming this way? Why me?_

Three ripples.

Then she stopped. The hem of her dress just inches from my face. I didn't dare to breathe.

And then, without hesitation, without mercy, she lowered herself to the floor—

Directly between my legs.

My one brain cell, which had just clocked in for its shift, immediately filed an HR complaint for unsafe working conditions.

“Uh—Wha—What the hell are you doing?!”

"We're both right-handed," she explained, her voice a calm sea in my hurricane of panic. She shifted slightly, her lower back brushing against my knees. "I was having trouble seeing the angle from over there."

Her words barely registered. Her face was too close when she turned to speak. Her back was too close. Her _everything_ was too freaking close. 

A sweet, floral scent wafted from her hair, and suddenly, I was standing in a meadow. The grass was waist-high, a sea of green and gold swaying in a gentle breeze. The sun was high in the sky, its light bathing me in warmth. It was radiant. Peaceful.

But something was wrong. Far off to the left, the grass bent and parted, pushed aside by something moving low and fast. I turned, but it was gone. Then there was a stir to the right, closer this time, but it again vanished before I could pin it down. The meadow stilled once more, but the silence pressed down on me. It was suffocating. The trap was set. All around me, the grass shivered as the shadows closed in—and then her hand clamped down over mine. There was no pulling free.

"How am I supposed to learn if you don't show me?" she asked, her voice impossibly calm. "Here, just hold them like you usually do."

She placed the chopsticks in my hand.

Thank god for muscle memory, because my brain cell had just pulled out a tiny picket sign and gone on strike. It was demanding better pay, and significantly less life-threatening situations.

My fingers automatically arranged themselves into the proper grip. About time somebody in this body did their damn job.

"I see..." Lily murmured. "So that's how it's done."

Her words were just background noise. All of my fried senses were focused on her fingers, lightly tracing the back of my hand as she examined my grip. They were warm. Her breath was warm. No, it was hot. My hand was BURNING. The entire meadow was on fire. Everything was on fire. I was on fire.

Through the flames, I could feel her hand close over mine, guiding the chopsticks. She moved them, testing the grip, opening and closing the tips. 

_*Chomp.*_

My eyes snapped down. Lily had leaned forward and had taken a bite of noodles from my cup. She had, for all intents and purposes, fed herself with my hand.

"Mm," she hummed thoughtfully. "These are surprisingly tasty."

A deal was struck with the union. The strike was over. My brain cell returned to its post just in time to file the after-action report: *we have concluded that those are the chopsticks the host used just moments before; therefore, that counts as an indirect ki*—

That was it. I snapped. I scrambled to my feet, nearly knocking over my entire cup.{but lily is between her and the cup} "Sorry! Need to—cool off!"

"I suppose the soup does make you warm," she said, tilting her head with that infuriating innocence.

I practically fled towards the bathroom, my one sanctuary.

"It's a shame, though," her voice called out after me. "We'll have to leave Part Two of the lesson for next time."

I froze, my hand on the doorknob. Ice water flowed through my veins as I slowly turned my head. "...There's a Part Two?"

"Of course," she said, smiling sweetly. "The lesson only works if both girls feed each other, right? We'll need to practice more."

A shiver ran down my spine. I wrenched the bathroom door open and escaped, slamming it shut behind me.
