A pair of chopsticks hovered in front of my eyes like sharp claws readied to strike.

"I don't think I'll ever figure out what's supposed to be so charming about these things if I can't even hold them right." Her deceptively sweet voice echoed in my head, bouncing off the walls and cornering me. 

I swallowed. Hard.

My eyes fell on her slender fingers, curling around the wood with unnerving grace. Then I flinched as my gaze suddenly met hers. Those terrifying red eyes.

*No Karin, this is not the timid girl from last night.*

"I think you’ll need to give me a lesson..." 

Her lips curved into a sharp smile that could cut glass.

"*Sensei*."

*No, this is a goddamn predator, and you are its damned prey.*

She lowered the chopsticks. Slowly. From my eyes… to my cheeks. From my cheeks… to my lips.

*Stay absolutely still, Karin. Their vision is based on movement.*

Her eyes, still glowing with that demonic red light, never left mine.

*\*Click\**

The chopsticks snapped shut just in front of my mouth, and I flinched. The sharp sound brought me back to myself, just enough to croak out a reply.

"Sure…" I managed, trying to put on a confident air. "A-anything you want."

I mean, what else could I say? I couldn’t shatter her image of Ringo-sensei as the cool-as-hell mentor, the all-knowing guide. That’s why she kept coming back. If I couldn’t play the part, why would she stay?

So here I was, practically volunteering for slaughter.

I took a deep breath. My only hope was to summon her: the confident, brilliant author who lived in my head. The one who ate normies like her for breakfast. She was the only one who could handle this.

I reached for the door to Ringo-sensei’s office... but it was slammed shut. A hastily scrawled sign was tacked to the front:

OUT OF OFFICE. GOOD LUCK!

There was no escape.

I was completely, utterly, royally screwed.


*Okay. Relax, Karin. Just... help her. Give her some simple pointers, a basic example. It's just chopsticks, it'll be fine. She's just a girl. No matter how terrifyingly beautiful she is.*

_Oh no._

It was too late when I realized my fatal mistake.  

*They can smell fear.*

She rose from her cushion in one fluid motion, but I didn't miss that damned demonic glint as she stood. She had just locked onto her prey.

She moved quickly, her movements betraying no sound. Not even the whisper of fabric. Not when she was hunting.

But I noticed the ripples on my instant noodle. She was getting closer.

One ripple.

My pulse hammered so hard against my ribs I was sure the entire kotatsu was shaking with it.

Two ripples.

The alarms in my head screamed louder with each step. _Why is she coming this way? Why me?_

Three ripples.

Then she stopped. The hem of her dress just inches from my face. I didn't dare to breathe.

And then, without hesitation, without mercy, she lowered herself to the floor—

Directly between my legs.

My one brain cell, which had just clocked in for its shift, immediately filed an HR complaint for unsafe working conditions.

“Uh—Wha—What the hell are you doing?!”

"We're both right-handed," she explained, her voice a calm sea in my hurricane of panic. She shifted slightly, her lower back brushing against my knees. "I was having trouble seeing the angle from over there."

Her words barely registered. Her face was too close when she turned to speak. Her back was too close. Her _everything_ was too freaking close. 

A sweet, floral scent wafted from her hair, and suddenly, I was standing in a meadow. The grass was waist-high, a sea of green and gold swaying in a gentle breeze. The sun was high in the sky, its light bathing me in warmth. It was radiant. Peaceful.

But something was wrong. Far off to the left, the grass bent and parted, pushed aside by something moving low and fast. I turned, but it was gone. Then there was a stir to the right, closer this time, but it again vanished before I could pin it down. The meadow stilled once more, but the silence pressed down on me. It was suffocating. The trap was set. All around me, the grass shivered as the shadows closed in—and then her hand clamped down over mine. There was no pulling free.

"How am I supposed to learn if you don't show me?" she asked, her voice impossibly calm. "Here, just hold them like you usually do."

She placed the chopsticks in my hand.

Thank god for muscle memory, because my brain cell had just pulled out a tiny picket sign and gone on strike. It was demanding better pay, and significantly less life-threatening situations.

My fingers automatically arranged themselves into the proper grip. About time somebody in this body did their damn job.

"I see..." Lily murmured. "So that's how it's done."

Her words were just background noise. All of my fried senses were focused on her fingers, lightly tracing the back of my hand as she examined my grip. They were warm. Her breath was warm. No, it was hot. My hand was BURNING. The entire meadow was on fire. Everything was on fire. I was on fire.

Through the flames, I could feel her hand close over mine, guiding the chopsticks. She moved them, testing the grip, opening and closing the tips. 

_*Chomp.*_

My eyes snapped down. Lily had leaned forward and had taken a bite of noodles from my cup. She had, for all intents and purposes, fed herself with my hand.

"Mm," she hummed thoughtfully. "These are surprisingly tasty."

A deal was struck with the union. The strike was over. My brain cell returned to its post just in time to file the after-action report: *we have concluded that those are the chopsticks the host used just moments before; therefore, that counts as an indirect ki*—

That was it. I snapped. I scrambled to my feet, nearly knocking over my entire cup.{but lily is between her and the cup} "Sorry! Need to—cool off!"

"I suppose the soup does make you warm," she said, tilting her head with that infuriating innocence.

I practically fled towards the bathroom, my one sanctuary.

"It's a shame, though," her voice called out after me. "We'll have to leave Part Two of the lesson for next time."

I froze, my hand on the doorknob. Ice water flowed through my veins as I slowly turned my head. "...There's a Part Two?"

"Of course," she said, smiling sweetly. "The lesson only works if both girls feed each other, right? We'll need to practice more."

A shiver ran down my spine. I wrenched the bathroom door open and escaped, slamming it shut behind me.

I stayed in the bathroom for a few minutes, splashing cold water on my face until the heat in my cheeks finally subsided. When I finally worked up the nerve to emerge, the bizarreness of the scene that greeted me hit me.  

There, sitting at my kotatsu, was the goddess-slash-demon from just a moment ago. But now, she was just… a girl. A girl clumsily chasing a stray piece of pork around her cup of instant noodles with chopsticks she still hadn’t mastered. Somehow the terrifying creature from five minutes ago was losing a fight to my sad excuse for breakfast. My life was a joke.  

I glanced at the door leading out into the hallway and sighed. I still owed her an apology for yesterday.  

Quietly, I made my way back to my seat. She finally managed to corner the piece of pork and looked up at me with a huge, triumphant smile. Then, as if it were totally normal, she hit me with the one thing I’d been dreading.  {Let's have change this part to have them finish their food in quiet}

{After they are done, Lily asks if she can grab another book, since she already finished the last one}

{Karin just tells her to help herself and keeps observing has she happily grabs one of the books from the selves}

{When Karin notes which one it is she sighs (make up a yuri title)}

{Karin stands up and grabs the book from her hands, then she swiftly replaces it with another, tamer book (make up another title)}

{Lily pouts a little but opens up the other book}
 
“So, you never told me why I never see you in our lectures.”

I froze, chopsticks halfway to my mouth. I put them down slowly. Here it comes. The judgment. The pity. 

I took a deep breath, bracing myself. But when I looked at her, all I could see was naive curiosity. No smirk, no fake sympathy. Just the same dumb smile I was beginning to get used to.

And for some stupid reason, that made me open my mouth.

"I don't really go," I mumbled. "Lately… it's been getting harder to leave my room. It started in high school, but it's gotten worse..."  

Her eyes never left me. She wasn't even eating anymore. All she did was nod my way to signal me to continue. Which somehow worked, because the words kept tumbling out.

"I don't know how to describe it. Just walking out feels like—" I shook my head. “Scary. Like really freaking scary."

And then the worst part slipped out before I could stop it. “The other night… when you ran off after I—” my throat caught, “after I was a complete jerk to you… that was the first time I froze at my own doorway.”

*My safe space just keeps getting smaller and smaller.*

God, what was I even doing? Who info‑dumps their pathetic backstory to a girl they barely know? A loser, that's who. 

I braced myself, but she just nodded, as if I’d just told her the weather. There was no pity in her eyes. 

After a moment, she spoke. "I see. In that case, how about a deal?"

I looked up, confused. "A deal?"

"You're having trouble going to class," she stated simply. "And I'm having trouble understanding what's going on _in_ class." A small, wry smile touched her lips. 

She leaned forward slightly. "So, I'll go to every lecture and bring you back the notes. And in return… you can help me actually understand them."

I was stunned. I was so sure she was going to try to "fix" me, or tell me to just "get over it" and go outside. But she didn't do that. She just… accepted it. Is she really just that much of an airhead? Or is she actually just… kind? No—that couldn’t be it. Not for me. Definitely not for someone like me.

"You'd be better off asking Risa," I deflected. "She's actually smart. And really good at computers."

"But Risa isn't my teacher," she cut in. "You are."

My mouth snapped shut.

I stared at her, a strange warmth spreading through my chest that I did not know how to process. But maybe it wouldn’t be so bad if she had something other than the Yuri Lessons as an excuse to come here.

"So, deal?" she asked, a small smile playing on her lips. She held out her chopsticks.

After a beat, I lifted my own. With a soft click, our chopsticks touched, sealing the pact.



Help me rewrite the opening of this scene to add a new cute interaction. 

After leaving the bathroom, she finds Lily looking through the shelves as if she was in her own house. She grabs one model of manga
