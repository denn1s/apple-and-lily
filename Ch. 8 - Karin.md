A pair of chopsticks hovered in front of my eyes like a pair of sharp claws readied to strike.  
  
“I don't think I'll ever figure out what's supposed to be so charming about these things if I can't even hold them right.” Her deceptively sweet voice echoed in my head, bouncing off the walls and cornering me.   
  
I swallowed. Hard.  
  
My eyes fell on her slender fingers, curling around the wood with unnerving grace. Then I flinched as my gaze suddenly met hers. Those terrifying red eyes.  
  
*No Karin, this is not the timid girl from last night.*  
  
“I think you’ll need to give me a lesson…”   
  
Her lips curved into a sharp smile that could cut glass.  
  
“*Sensei*.”  
  
*No, this is a goddamn predator, and you are its damned prey.*  
  
She lowered the sharp point of the chopsticks. Slowly. From my eyes… to my cheeks. From my cheeks… to my lips.  
  
*Stay absolutely still, Karin. Their vision is based on movement.*  
  
Her eyes, those mesmerizing eyes, locked onto mine and wouldn't let go. I felt myself drawn towards her. They held me captive and pulled me closer and closer, ever so slightly…  
  
*\*Click\**  
  
I flinched. The chopsticks had snapped shut just in front of my face. Their abrupt sound brought me back to myself, just enough to croak out a reply.  
  
“Sure…” I managed, trying to put on a last-minute confident air. “A-anything you want.”  
  
I mean, what else could I say? I couldn't shatter her image of Ringo-sensei as the unshakable mentor, the all-knowing guide. That's why she kept coming back. If I couldn't play the part, her visits would stop.  
  
So here I was, practically volunteering for slaughter.  
  
I took a deep breath. My only hope was to summon her: the confident, brilliant author who lived in my head. The one who ate normies like her for breakfast. She was the only one who could handle this.  
  
I reached for the door to Ringo-sensei’s office… but it was slammed shut. A hastily scrawled sign was tacked to the front:  
  
OUT OF OFFICE. GOOD LUCK!  
  
There was no escape.  
  
Goddammit. I was completely, utterly, and royally screwed.  
  
*Okay. Relax, Karin. Just… help her. Give her some simple pointers, a basic example. It's just chopsticks; it'll be fine. She's just a girl. No matter how terrifyingly beautiful she is.*  
  
_Oh no._  
  
It was too late when I realized my fatal mistake.    
  
*They can smell fear.*  
  
I didn't miss that damned demonic glint as she stood from her cushion. She had just locked onto her prey.  
  
She moved quickly, her movements betraying no sound. Not even the whisper of fabric. Not when she was hunting.  
  
But I noticed the ripples on my instant noodles. She was getting closer.  
  
One ripple.  
  
My pulse pounded so violently I couldn't hear anything but the deafening roar of blood rushing through my head.

Two ripples.  

I uncrossed my legs and scrambled backward on my hands and feet, putting distance between us across the floor.  
  
Three ripples.  

  
Then she stopped. Her back was facing my way, and the hem of her dress was just inches from my face. I didn't dare to breathe. She stood there, right between my legs, for the longest goddamn second in my miserable life.  
  
And then, without hesitation, without mercy, she lowered herself to the floor—  
  
Directly between my legs.  
  
My one brain cell, which had just clocked in for its shift, immediately filed a complaint with HR for unsafe working conditions.  
  
“Uh—Wha—What the hell are you doing?!”  
  
“We're both right-handed,” she explained, calm, like she was reading the freaking dictionary.

“I was having trouble seeing the angle from over there.” Her words barely registered. Her face was too close when she turned to speak. Her back was too close. Her _everything_ was too freaking close. 

She shifted slightly, her lower back brushing against my shin. I swear my entire nervous system was a nanosecond away from a full core meltdown.  

Then, a sweet, flowery scent reached me from her hair, and all of a sudden I found myself in a wide meadow. The grass was waist-high, a sea of green and gold swaying in the gentle breeze. The sun was high in the sky, its light bathing me in warmth. It was radiant. Peaceful…  
  
But something was wrong. Far off to the left, the grass bent and parted, pushed aside by something moving low and fast. I turned, but it was gone. Then there was a stir to the right, closer this time, but it again vanished before I could pin it down. The meadow stilled once more, but the silence pressed down on me. It was suffocating. The trap was set. All around me, the grass shivered as the shadows closed in—and then…

Her hand clamped down over mine.  
  
“How am I supposed to learn if you don't show me?” she asked, her voice annoyingly collected. “Here, just hold them like you usually do.”  
  
She placed the chopsticks in my hand.  
  
Thank god for muscle memory, because my brain cell had just pulled out a tiny picket sign and gone on strike. It was demanding better pay and significantly less life-threatening situations. My fingers automatically arranged themselves into the proper grip. 

“I see…” Lily murmured. “So that's how it's done.”  
  
Her words were just background noise as what was left of my senses focused on how her breath felt warm against my skin. No, not warm—it was hot. It was _*scalding*_. My hand was burning, and the heat was spreading up my arm. Everything was on fire. I was on fire. The heat was melting me from the inside out. I could feel it rise through my neck, turning my bones to liquid, my cheeks into hot lava, and finally my brain into mush.  

Through the cinders of what was left of my body, I felt her fingers wrap around the back of my hand. She moved the chopsticks in my grip around and even clicked them around as if testing them…

And then…
  
_*Chomp.*_  
  
I stared in shock as she leaned forward and helped herself to noodles straight from my cup. With MY chopsticks. She had, for all intents and purposes, fed herself with my hand.  
  
“Mm,” she hummed thoughtfully. “These are surprisingly tasty.”  
  
A deal was struck with the union. The strike was over. My brain cell returned to its post just in time to file the after-action report: 
*We have concluded that those are the chopsticks the host used just moments before; therefore, that counts as an indirect ki—*  
  
That was it. I snapped. I scrambled to my feet, nearly pushing her off. “Sorry! Need to—cool off!”  
  
“I suppose the soup does make you warm,” she said, tilting her head with that infuriating innocence.  
  
I practically fled towards the bathroom, my one safe haven.  
  
“It's a shame, though,” her voice called out. “We'll have to leave Part Two of the lesson for another day.”  
  
I froze, my hand on the doorknob. Ice water flowed through my veins as I slowly turned my head. “… T-There's a Part T-Two?”  
  
“Of course,” she said, smiling sweetly. “The lesson only works if both girls feed each other, right? We'll need to practice some more.”  
  
A shiver ran down my spine. I wrenched the bathroom door open and escaped, slamming it shut behind me.  
  
---  
  
I stayed in the bathroom for a few minutes, splashing cold water on my face until the heat in my cheeks finally subsided. When I finally worked up the nerve to get back, the bizarreness of the scene that greeted me hit me.    
  
There, sitting at my kotatsu, was the goddess-slash-demon from just a moment ago. But now, she was just… a girl. A girl clumsily chasing noodles around her cup. Somehow the terrifying creature from five minutes ago was losing a fight to my sad excuse for breakfast. My life was a joke.    
  
I glanced at the door leading out into the hallway and sighed. I still owed her an apology for yesterday.    
  
Quietly, I made my way back to my seat. I stared as she finally managed to corner a single noodle and looked up at me with a huge, triumphant smile. But then, the noodle slipped from her chopsticks, and her face crumpled into pure devastation. I had to bite my lips to stifle a laugh.

After holding a pout for a minute, Lily, as in retaliation, hit me with the one question I’d been dreading.  
  
“So, how come I never see you in my lectures? You didn't tell me yesterday.”    
  
I froze, should I tell her? Will she laugh? Cry? Honestly I didn't know which one was worse.

For some stupid reason, I opened my mouth.  
  
“I don't really go,” I mumbled, my fingers fidgeting with the hem of my hoodie.

“Lately…” I took a shaky breath, tasting the lingering salt from the noodles. “It's been getting harder to leave my room. It started in high school, but it's gotten worse…”

Here it comes. The judgment. The pity. I braced myself, tensing my shoulders. But when I looked at her, all I could see was naive curiosity. No smirk, no fake sympathy. Just the same dumb smile I was beginning to get used to. Which somehow worked, because the words kept tumbling out.  
  
“I don't know how to describe it. Just walking out feels like—” I shook my head. “Scary. Like really freaking scary.”  
  
And last night… that was the first time I froze at my doorway. At my own damn doorway.  
  
*Will my safe space keep getting smaller?*  
  
God, what was I even doing? Who info‑dumps their pathetic backstory to a girl they barely know? 

A loser, that's who. A complete, absolute, utter failure of a human being.  
  
I braced myself again, but she was just nodding, as if I’d just told her the weather. There was no pity in her eyes.
  
After a moment, she spoke. “I see. In that case, how about a deal?”  
  
I looked up, confused. “A deal?”  
  
“You're having trouble going to class,” she stated simply. “And I'm having trouble understanding what's going on _in_ class.” A small, wry smile touched her lips.   
  
“So, I'll go to every lecture and bring you back the notes. And in return… you can help me actually get through them.”  She finished proudly, as if she was getting the best part of the deal.
  
I was stunned. I was so sure she was going to try to “help” me, try to drag me outside to face it, and then make fun of me when I failed. Not this.

She was more worried about classes? Is she really just that much of an airhead? Or is she actually just… really kind? No—that couldn’t be it. Not for me. Definitely not for someone like me.  
  
“If you need help, you'd be better off asking Risa,” I deflected. “She's the one who is really good with computers—”  
  
“But Risa isn't my teacher,” she cut in. “You are.”  
  
My mouth snapped shut, and I stared at her as a strange warmth spread through my chest. I didn't know how to process it. I didn't know how to process any of this.

But I was sure of one thing. It wouldn’t be so bad if she had something other than those ridiculous Yuri Lessons as an excuse to come here.  
  
“So, deal?” she asked, a small smile playing on her lips. She held out her chopsticks.  
  
After a beat, I lifted my own, and with a soft click, we shook our chopsticks, sealing the pact.
